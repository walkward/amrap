{"Sheet1":[{"id":"212","Title":"6 Tricks to Master Your Eating Habits","Content":"<p style=\"color: #444444;\">There are all kinds of reasons we eat: happiness, sadness, boredom, excitement, stress, exhaustion. If we're doing it right, we might be really focused on fueling our workouts. If we're feeling indulgent, we might eat just to enjoy the simple, luscious pleasure of the taste of a favorite food.</p>\nThe best emotional gift I've received from eating paleo is that 95% of the time, I don't eat <em>solely</em> for pleasure. That doesn't mean my food isn't pleasurable. But thanks to the things I've learned about my eating patterns, most of the time, I eat to thrive. And on those rare occasions when I do eat treats for the pure pleasure of it, I enjoy them immensely.\n\nI’ve learned how to avoid pandering to my emotions with food, and you can, too!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Food Will Not Permanently Change Our Emotional State</strong>\n\nThe <em>numero uno</em> thing that's helped me is the realization that eating \"comfort\" food will not change my emotional state in the way I want. It might provide a momentary distraction – and momentary pleasure – but whatever I'm dealing with... happiness, frustration, anger, fear, worry, excitement, boredom... whatever emotional state I'm in will still exist <strong>after</strong> I've eaten the food. And in most cases, depending on what I ate and how much, I could make my emotional state worse. The food, usually, will not make it better. The exception to this rule, of course, is if I'm eating because of real hunger. So the trick becomes (1) feeling the difference between hunger and emotional appetite; and (2) feeding the hunger with real, paleo food; and (3) feeding the emotional appetite with something other than food to recognize and validate those emotions.\n\nThat's pretty simple to understand, but it can be tricky to put into practice.\n\nThe key is to be as present and mindful as possible because it's about so much more than eating. It's about knowing ourselves, understanding our emotional storms, and <strong>thinking</strong> our way out of behaving in a way that's driven by emotions.\n\nPractically speaking, here are some tricks that have helped me\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>1. I never have anything in the house that's not on the paleo-approved list of foods.</strong>\n\nThat way, if I have an unpleasant \"grazing\" session, I'm at least overeating on foods that won't hurt me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>2. Drink a glass of water. Or two.</strong>\n\nI know it sounds like an old dieters' trick, but it also helps me slow down and <strong>think</strong> about what I'm doing. It's the breather to help determine the difference between true hunger and emotional appetite.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>3. Make it a challenge.</strong>\n\nSometimes the brat in me wins, and I think I don't care if I'm just feeding my emotional appetite. When that happens, I appeal to that bratty side and make it like a workout. I set a 20-minute timer and challenge myself to not eat a damn thing until the timer goes off. If at the end of those 20 minutes, I'm hungry, I eat a paleo snack. If at the end of the 20 minutes, I just still \"really want something,\" I give myself a stern talking to and ban myself from the kitchen. Sometimes it really is just about muscling it out. It's unpleasant, but I refuse to be ruled by false messages sent to my body by my fickle emotions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>4. \"Kitchen's closed.”</strong>\n\nI tell myself that after dinner... or in the afternoon when I want the pleasure of eating, but I'm not actually hungry. I say it out loud, \"Kitchen's closed.\" I pretend I live on a cruise ship or at a resort with ridiculously tight-fisted rules about the pantry, and when the kitchen is closed, it's <strong>closed</strong>. Yes, it's maybe a little silly, but the imagination is a very powerful tool. (I do the same thing when it's time for me to go to bed, but I don't feel sleepy. I say to myself, \"It's time to get sleepy.\" and start tricking my body into believing it.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>5. Meditate, dance, cry, talk it out.</strong>\n\nEmotions will not be denied, so when I realize I want to eat because of an emotional appetite, I know I need to find a way to deal with those emotions. Sometimes it's as simple as telling someone I trust what's on my mind. Other times, I need to crank some music or indulge in a really good cry. Emotions are like a vampire; they will have their due and the best way to move through them is to give them attention but not the food they want. <strong>You</strong> don't want that food, the emotion does. Let it go calorie-hungry and feed it with attention instead.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>6. Enlist an ally.</strong>\n\nEveryone I work with and all of my blog readers and all of my Twitter and Facebook peeps know that I'm committed to taking good care of myself with paleo food. And I know that if I turn to them for a word of encouragement, I'll get it. Use the tools and people around you for support. Reach out to likeminded people on Twitter and Facebook. Recruit your co-workers. Enlist a family member. It's totally OK to complain about wanting to eat; most people will sympathize... and then they can help you sort out if you're really hungry or if something else is going on. I'm always amazed at how once I’ve said, \"I really want to eat [insert the name of something that doesn't make me healthier]\" the hold it has on me evaporates. Try it!\n\nCooking and eating quality food is among the most caring things you can do for yourself and others — and learning the difference between emotional appetite and true hunger will help you make food choices that nourish you, body and soul.\n<h4 style=\"color: #444444;\">By: <a href=\"http://www.theclothesmakethegirl.com\" target=\"_blank\">Melissa Joulwan</a></h4>\n\n<hr />\n\nMelissa Joulwan is the author of <a href=\"(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/061557226X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=061557226X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=roltheboo-20)\" target=\"_blank\">Well Fed: Paleo Recipes For People Who Love To Eat</a>, <a href=\"(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0989487504/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0989487504&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=roltheboo-20)\" target=\"_blank\">Well Fed 2: More Paleo Recipes For People Who Love To Eat</a>, <a href=\"(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/111829405X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=111829405X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=roltheboo-20)\" target=\"_blank\">Living Paleo For Dummies</a>, and the blog <a href=\"http://www.theclothesmakethegirl.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Clothes Make The Girl</a>.\n\n&nbsp;","Slug":"6-tricks-master-eating-habits","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/nutrition_hacks/6-tricks-master-eating-habits/","Path":"/nutrition_hacks/6-tricks-master-eating-habits/","Date":"2014-08-05","Year":"2014","Month":"08","Day":"05","Categories":"Nutrition Hacks","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_140595652.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_140595652.jpg","Image Alt Text":"Reprogram Why You Eat"},{"id":"217","Title":"Lessons Learned from My Journey to Best Self","Content":"<p style=\"color: #444444;\">I’ve had a weight loss goal since I was 13 years old.</p>\nThat’s more than 30 years of living with a number hanging over my head. From Weight Watchers summer camp to the rice diet to Kathy Smith’s Fat Burning Plan to Weight Watchers to the Zone to Paleo… with aerobics videos and step aerobics and triathlons and boxing and Roller Derby and half marathons and CrossFit along the way.\n\nMy motivations have been many. Fear of being fat. Health concerns. Peer pressure to conquer the 200# deadlift. A personal sense of pride. Unadulterated vanity.\n\nThose motivations shaped my behavior. I ate “right” so I would reach my Weight Watchers goal weight. I set my alarm for 5:00 a.m. so I would some day see my name on the RX or PR board at my CrossFit gym. I was driven by a sometimes debilitating fear that I would never be “better.”\n\nThen a thought began to flicker in my subconscious. It started, I think, on holiday in Prague when I realized I liked exploring narrow, winding stairways. I was starting to loosen my grip on “destination” and reveling in the “getting there.” That idea tickled me again when I was upside down during a handstand at the gym and during a (totally fun, stopwatch-and-music free) run around the lake. What if my goals have been backwards?\n\nWhat if I’ve been looking at this thing from the wrong direction all along?\n\nMy underlying motivation for all of it – the weight loss, the physical challenges, the healthy eating – has always been that I wanted to be the best version of myself that I could possibly be. Happy, healthy, fit, strong, attractive. But that pure motivation got bastardized into numbers and external measures that divorced what I wanted from what I did.\n\nSo I got this notion to try something different. For the first time in more than three decades, what if I don’t set a physical goal? No weight loss, no \"leaning out,\" no target time on the clock or weight on the bar.\n\nInstead, what if I just behaved like the best version of myself? Then I would become her.\n\nThe best me eats clean and sleeps well and trains hard and smiles a lot. She’s free of worrying about what number might appear on a scale or a measuring tape. Instead of being intimidated or threatened by stronger, faster, leaner classmates at the gym, she delights in their capabilities. And she remembers to encourage the people around her to be their best versions.\n\nFinally, the best version of me knows that she's not required to eat clean or meditate or practice yoga or lift heavy or get solid sleep. There is no accounting ledger keeping track of exemplary behavior for a reward later. There is no intrinsic value in checking off tasks on a list to earn a metaphorical gold star.\n\nThe clean eating and training meditation and lifting and sleeping are the reward. They are the thing.\n\nSo I’ve banished my “concrete” fitness goals. I know that “Be the best version of me” doesn’t follow the SMART goal format. I don’t care.\n\nI’ve done it the conventional way. Now I’m doing it my way.\n\nBecause the best version of me refuses to be measured by some external yardstick.\n\nThe best version of me happily goes to bed early, wakes up refreshed, eats paleo, trains wisely, lifts heavy things, remembers to take a fun run and to play a little every day, spreads love, looks up, leads with the chin, makes up new recipes, and sings out loud.\n\nNot because I must.\n\nBecause I want to. Because that’s me. The best me.\n\nWhat is the best version of you? Not the one you think other people want to see or the one the media thinks you should be... but the one you desire, deep down, to be? Can you live the best version of you, without judgment? Without punishment? Without reward? Can you revel in the you-ness of you?\n<h4 style=\"color: #444444;\">By <a href=\"http://www.theclothesmakethegirl.com\" target=\"_blank\">Melissa Joulwan</a></h4>\n\n<hr />\n\nMelissa Joulwan is the author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/061557226X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=061557226X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=roltheboo-20)\" target=\"_blank\">Well Fed: Paleo Recipes For People Who Love To Eat </a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0989487504/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0989487504&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=roltheboo-20)\" target=\"_blank\">Well Fed 2: More Paleo Recipes For People Who Love To Eat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/111829405X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=111829405X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=roltheboo-20)\" target=\"_blank\">Living Paleo For Dummies</a>, and the blog <a href=\"http://www.theclothesmakethegirl.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Clothes Make The Girl</a>.\n\n&nbsp;","Slug":"experience-full-potential","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/everything_crossfit/experience-full-potential/","Path":"/everything_crossfit/experience-full-potential/","Date":"2014-08-05","Year":"2014","Month":"08","Day":"05","Categories":"Everything CrossFit | Nutrition Hacks","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_141725047.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_202235605-copy.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_202235605.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_141725047.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_202235605-copy.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_202235605.jpg","Image Alt Text":"Better version of yourself"},{"id":"310","Title":"Wake Up Refreshed: 3 Paleo Breakfast Foods to Start Your Day Right","Content":"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so people say. You have heard it time and time again, yet somehow this meal seems to be the one that people skip most often due to busy schedules or lack of hunger in the morning. But reaching for something nutritious first thing in the morning can give your body the jumpstart it needs to power through the day and leave you minus the cravings, drops in energy levels and low metabolism.\n\nWhen you want to keep your body moving throughout the day, here are three easy and fast breakfast foods to reach for that will fit in with your Paleo diet regime.\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Eggs – </strong>Eggs are rich in protein and are the perfect way to start your morning. This highly nutritious ingredient can be served up in a variety of ways, including scrambled, in an omelet packed full of vegetables, or baked for a quick nutritious bite on the go. We love the protein found in eggs so much that we have even added egg white protein to our AMRAP Refuel bars to give our athletes the energy boost they need from this power food.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sweet Potatoes – </strong>While you may think sweet potatoes make for an odd breakfast choice, consider mashed sweet potatoes for breakfast over your regular bowl of oatmeal. This food is rich in complex carbohydrates giving you an energy boost and leaving you feeling full throughout the morning. Add a small amount of honey, cinnamon and coconut milk to give it the creamy texture with a touch of sweetness.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Green Vegetables – </strong>Eating spinach for breakfast may seem like an odd idea but putting it in your favorite smoothie combined with some water, fresh fruit juice or coconut milk can help you get your veggies without sacrificing your appetite. There are hundreds of smoothie recipes that make getting your greens in the morning easy. One of our favorites is coconut milk, a handful of spinach leaves, half a frozen banana and some frozen berries. Eat this together with an AMRAP Refuel bar and you will be fueled up with energy that will last you all morning.</li>\n</ol>\nBreakfast is an easy meal to overlook but eating a healthy breakfast can help you get a head start to a great day. When you fuel up with these top Paleo breakfast ingredients, you get the nutrition you need to feel refreshed, energetic and ready to take on the day.

Whether you have counted points, calories or any other metric, dieting just seems too difficult to last for longer than a month or two. So why wouldn’t you feel the same about the Paleo diet?</p>\nMany people are rightfully leery about trying a new eating regime like the Paleo diet. Still, the Paleo diet has helped millions of people get healthier, lose weight and ultimately feel better overall. Here are a few reasons why you can believe that the Paleo diet is not just a fad.\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Our caveman ancestors ate Paleo – </strong>People have consumed a Paleo diet for centuries dating back to when humans were living in caves. Biologically, we are still cavemen and we should continue to eat like our caveman ancestors did. Our bodies continue to need the same types of nutrients found in the foods cavemen ate, and our bodies still do not know how to process the types of ingredients found in many of the foods that fill our grocery store shelves today.</li>\n\t<li><strong>You get all the nutrients you need – </strong>It has been said that the Paleo diet contains less calcium than diets consisting of dairy products. However, grass fed beef, spinach and other Paleo foods actually contain more calcium than a glass of milk that you would buy in the grocery store. This is true of other essential nutrients as well.</li>\n\t<li><strong>You always know what you are eating – </strong>Being able to pronounce all of the ingredients in the food you consume helps you to know exactly what you are putting into your body. Instead of eating chemically enhanced foods filled with ingredient lists that are enough to intimidate anyone without a PhD in science, the Paleo diet allows you to choose clean ingredients so that you know exactly what you consume each and every meal.</li>\n\t<li><strong>You get to try a variety of foods –</strong> Eating too much of anything can get boring very quickly. That’s the reason why so many diets fail over time. But with the Paleo diet, boredom is never a factor. With the variety of seasonal fruits and vegetables and the abundance of Paleo recipes available, this diet is constantly varied.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Insulin levels stay in line – </strong>There are certain types of food that cause insulin levels to go out of control and spike suddenly. This can lead to chronic and life threatening diseases, such as Diabetes or obesity. With the Paleo diet, you are able to keep your insulin levels at a much more reasonable level and avoid the risk of chronic illness.</li>\n\t<li><strong>You have more energy – </strong>When you eat right, you feel better. Your body has more energy to get work done, your cognitive functions are enhanced and overall you can tell that you feel right. This is enough to keep you on board with the Paleo diet for longer than a few weeks or months.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Meals are easier to prepare – </strong>When you have simple ingredients, there is far less chaos in the kitchen. Therefore, sticking with Paleo meals means easier and faster preparation of daily foods.</li>\n\t<li><strong>You won’t have a lingering feeling of hunger – </strong>When you eat protein rich foods and the right types of carbohydrates and fats, you are left to feel full and satisfied for longer. Unlike fast foods or foods high in processed sugars that can cause your body to crash, you feel full for longer and don’t have that nagging feeling of hunger that you get with many other diets.</li>\n\t<li><strong>You can always order at restaurants – </strong>Although you may seem limited in your choices with other diets, there are always Paleo options on the menu. Salads, steaks or burgers without the bun are easy ways to stay on board with your diet making this a lifestyle more than a fad.</li>\n\t<li><strong>You will have more confidence – </strong>A little vanity goes a long way when it comes to sticking with something new like the Paleo diet. When you look good and feel good, it is hard not to be confident. This confidence is a sure fire way to keep yourself strong and loving the Paleo diet.</li>\n</ol>\nNow that you know how easy and effective this diet can be, when will you make the switch to eat like our hunter and gatherer ancestors once did?\n\n&nbsp;","Slug":"10-reasons-paleo-fad-diet","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/nutrition_hacks/10-reasons-paleo-fad-diet/","Path":"/nutrition_hacks/10-reasons-paleo-fad-diet/","Date":"2014-08-11","Year":"2014","Month":"08","Day":"11","Categories":"Lifestyle Design | Nutrition Hacks","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_162794927.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_162794927.jpg"},{"id":"313","Title":"3 Paleo Foods to Eat Before a CrossFit Workout","Meta Description":"Pre-workout food is tricky for athletes. Because CrossFit workouts are known for their high intensity, identify good food to eat before a CrossFit workout","Content":"Crossfit workouts are known for their high intensity. Athletes that enter the Crossfit gym expect to push their own limits and get stronger. Some even make a trip to the notorious bucket affectionately titled “pukie”. To fuel your body through one of these grueling, yet addicting styles of workouts, you need the right type of nutrition before you enter the gym.\n\nPre-workout food can be tricky for many athletes. While some athletes cannot tolerate eating anything before a workout, particularly in the morning, there are others that feel they need some sort of nutrients in their body before starting a workout. Regardless, the idea of hitting the mat doing an unusually high number of burpees on a full stomach sounds less than appealing. Pre-workout foods tend to vary from person to person but there are still certain nutrients you will want in your stomach before you work out to help you power through - especially if you are aiming to beat your personal best or get on the whiteboard.\n\nHere are the top three foods you should eat before a Crossfit workout.\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Almond Butter – </strong>Almond butter is a favorite for many Crossfit athletes because it serves multiple purposes. First, it is high in protein which is essential to build stronger muscles and to help your muscles recovery properly from a workout. It is also a healthy type of fat which can give you some much needed energy throughout your workout. Eating almonds in a butter format will be easier on your stomach to digest than having to break down the nuts in their raw form and will still give you the nutritional benefits found in raw almonds.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Banana –</strong> Bananas are a carbohydrate that are packed full of potassium. This potassium serves as a much needed energy boost before a workout, as well as an essential nutrient to help your muscles heal once the workout is over. Depending on your weight, fitness level and goals, you may want to only eat a third or a half of a banana before a workout. Even this small amount of food will give you the energy boost and nutrients you need to feel your best during a Crossfit WOD.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Dates – </strong>This is another type of sugar that many athletes consume before a workout. Just a small amount can go a long way which can help you eat less and still get the carbohydrates in your body that will help you push you to your limits. Just eating one date may be able to give you enough of a boost to get you through a tough WOD without leaving you feeling overly full or bloated.</li>\n</ol>\nKeep in mind that because CrossFit workouts are known for their high intensity, you are best served to identify good food to eat before a CrossFit workout. Pre-workout nutrition tends to vary with each person, but for those who like to have something in their stomach before hitting the gym these tips can help you get the most out of your workout without feeling too full.

After all, Crossfit is about functional movement and the Paleo diet involves functional nutrition consisting only of the cleanest foods that can be found through a quick hunting and gathering trip outdoors. But Crossfit athletes are not the only ones who benefit from this type of nutrition.\n\nEndurance lovers who enjoy feeling their feet hit the ground as they glide over trails or along the pavement can also benefit. If you are that person, take this opportunity to learn how the Paleo diet benefits runners.\n\nHere are a few of the ways the Paleo diet can help runners achieve their maximum performance and reach new personal records in their race times.\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Reduced inflammation – </strong>One chronic problem runners have is inflammation in their joints from the repetitive pounding their body experiences each time they take a stride. With the Paleo diet, inflammatory foods, such as sugars, grains and rice are eliminated. Instead, the body is left with minimal inflammation from a diet filled with natural anti-inflammatory agents, such as Omega-3’s.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Faster recovery times –</strong> When you ingest foods, such as fruits, vegetables, lean meats, nuts and seeds, you are serving your body a higher dosage of branch chain amino acids. For runners, this means more muscle strength and faster recovery of sore or painful muscles. For any runner who has taken on a marathon, you know that fast recovery time is important to your training regimen. With the Paleo diet, your body is better equipped to bounce back faster after a race or a long run allowing you to hit the ground running more often and feel your best.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Leaner body –</strong> Weight loss is a nice side effect many people see with the Paleo diet. For runners, this can be extremely useful as running with more pounds around your mid-section or legs can slow you down and make it harder to do your best. The Paleo diet makes it easy to lose weight as the lean proteins boost your metabolism and keep you feeling full for longer so you are less likely to give in to your cravings.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Better structure for a healthy diet –</strong> Runners are often times seen reaching for energy drinks and gels to keep their glucose levels going. For some athletes, these gels constitute the extent of their nutritional intake leaving their sugar levels in a chaotic state and making it more difficult for their bodies to regulate this important level. With the Paleo diet, people are able to eat a healthier diet and keep their body filled with the nutrients they need to power be strong, recover quickly and feel their best overall.</li>\n</ul>\nThe Paleo diet is followed by people around the globe and has been for years. Now, more athletes and runners in particular are seeing the benefits of eating Paleo and use this diet as a guide to keep their nutrient levels high and their bodies feeling their best.","Slug":"paleo-diet-benefits-runners","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/nutrition_hacks/paleo-diet-benefits-runners/","Path":"/nutrition_hacks/paleo-diet-benefits-runners/","Date":"2014-08-11","Year":"2014","Month":"08","Day":"11","Categories":"Nutrition Hacks","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_123706795.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_123706795.jpg"},{"id":"315","Title":"Energy Boost: Top Paleo Ingredients that Deliver","Meta Description":"Average snack items are chalk full of sugar additives. It's time to consider paleo energy snacks that promote long-lasting energy without a sugar hangover.","Content":"You’re running low on energy at about 2:00 in the afternoon at work, what do you reach for? Chances are you are likely to grab the most convenient thing to give you a quick caloric boost and increase your energy levels at least until the end of the day. At many offices quick snacks often times consist of candy bars at the receptionist’s desk, chips from the vending machine or a soda from the refrigerator in the kitchen. But each of these items can actually have an adverse effect and while you may get a temporary sugar boost, you will quickly crash feeling worse off over time. It's time to consider paleo energy snacks that promote long-lasting natural release energy for your busy day.\n\nThe Paleo diet, or the diet of our caveman ancestors, has been around for years and for loyal followers to this diet, consistent energy levels, as well as a whole host of other benefits, has been a driving factor for people to continue eating hunter/gatherer style. The foods listed above, chips, candy or sugary soft drinks, all give you a quick energy rush because the sugar is let into your blood stream far too quickly. Then, your blood sugar levels drop and you are left to crash and burn without energy putting you in a vicious cycle.\n\nWith the Paleo diet, the foods you consume were meant to be eaten by humans and are therefore processed differently in your body leaving your blood sugar levels neutralized and more under control. Here are a few of the foods you can reach for to help fuel you when you are in need of a boost of energy.\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Lean protein</strong> – Most people believe that reaching for something sugary is the best way to get an energy boost, but in many cases protein can have an even longer lasting impact on your overall energy levels. Lean protein, such as turkey or chicken, can give your metabolism a boost and leave you feeling full for longer. This means no crash and better health overall for your body.</li>\n\t<li><strong>A handful of nuts</strong> – Nuts of any kind, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, contain protein and healthy forms of fat that can give your body a much needed energy boost without the risk of a spike in your sugar levels. You do not need many nuts to achieve the results you are after, so reach for a small handful and get back to being productive.</li>\n\t<li><strong>A cup of tea</strong> – If you are used to reaching for your double espresso filled with 12 pumps of sugar, you are only hurting yourself. Instead, drink a cup of tea. Tea is filled with less caffeine and more nutrients than any other soft drink or sugary coffee beverage which will keep you going for longer and leave you feeling lighter and better overall.</li>\n</ul>\nIt is important to note that the first few days of eating a Paleo diet, you may feel reduced energy levels as your body gets used to not having the spike in sugars and glucose. But as your sugar levels even out, eating Paleo ingredients over grains, sugars and salts will help you maintain steady glucose levels leaving you to feel healthier and more energetic overall.\n\nIf you find yourself tempted, keep an AMRAP refuel bar close by for when those cravings hit so you can have clean, nutritious energy to fuel you through the rest of your day.","Slug":"foods-fuel-top-paleo-ingredients-give-energy-boost","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/nutrition_hacks/foods-fuel-top-paleo-ingredients-give-energy-boost/","Path":"/nutrition_hacks/foods-fuel-top-paleo-ingredients-give-energy-boost/","Date":"2014-08-11","Year":"2014","Month":"08","Day":"11","Categories":"Nutrition Hacks","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_151822991.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_151822991.jpg"},{"id":"1178","Title":"The 4 Most Damaging Types of Training","Meta Description":"Bodybuilding, CrossFit, Running, and Powerlifting are very risky based on recent opinion.

I think the article might have been a little biased. Call me crazy. Written on a bodybuilding site.<strong><strong> </strong></strong>\n\nLets take a look at the risks, one more time shall we:\n\n<strong><strong> </strong></strong>\n<h3><b>Fourth most Risky Training: Bodybuilding</b></h3>\nHere is a quote from John Rusin, the author of the article:\n\n“Sure, bodybuilding has continued to draw some negative attention due to the blatant and obvious use of performance enhancing drugs, even within the \"natural\" divisions.”\n\nPerformance enhancing drugs? What do you mean, like steroids? So, it’s not natural to look like this:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/B.Chase-BBs.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1180\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/B.Chase-BBs-300x200.png\" alt=\"B.Chase - BBs\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>\n\nI did some really in-depth research (a quick google search “the risks of bodybuilding”) and found some concerns you may not have been aware concerning “performance enhancing drugs”:\n\nAnabolic steroids come with serious physical side effects as well.\n\nMen may develop:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Prominent breasts</li>\n\t<li>Baldness</li>\n\t<li>Shrunken testicles</li>\n\t<li>Infertility</li>\n\t<li>Impotence</li>\n</ul>\nWomen may develop:\n<ul>\n\t<li>A deeper voice</li>\n\t<li>An enlarged clitoris</li>\n\t<li>Increased body hair</li>\n\t<li>Baldness</li>\n\t<li>Infrequent or absent periods</li>\n</ul>\nBoth men and women might experience:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Severe acne</li>\n\t<li>Increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture</li>\n\t<li>Liver abnormalities and tumors</li>\n\t<li>Increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the \"bad\" cholesterol)</li>\n\t<li>Decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the \"good\" cholesterol)</li>\n\t<li>High blood pressure (hypertension)</li>\n\t<li>Heart and circulatory problems</li>\n\t<li>Prostate gland enlargement</li>\n\t<li>Aggressive behaviors, rage or violence</li>\n\t<li>Psychiatric disorders, such as depression</li>\n\t<li>Drug dependence</li>\n\t<li>Infections or diseases such as HIV or hepatitis if you're injecting the drugs</li>\n\t<li>Inhibited growth and development, and risk of future health problems in teenagers</li>\n</ul>\nSource: <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/fitness/in-depth/performance-enhancing-drugs/art-20046134\">http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/fitness/in-depth/performance-enhancing-drugs/art-20046134</a>\n\nI guess each man and woman has their own priorities. But I personally don’t like manboobs in my future. That is just me.\n\nIt’s helpful that you can breastfeed your child when you get older, so I am sure your future wives will appreciate that in the middle of the night when its your turn to feed the baby.\n\nI hope myfascial release is effective for manboobs.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>3rd most Risky Training: Powerlifting</b></h3>\nIt seems that T Nation published <a href=\"http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/westside_wisdom\">another article</a> where Louie Simmons describes how they avoid overtraining.\n\nThe article seems to make a pretty convincing case that powerlifting is safe and Louie is producing the strongest powerlifters in the world who are setting records in powerlifting without getting injured.\n\nIn fact, overtraining is something that Louie seems to have considered before. Louie quickly addresses some of the issues of overtraining in this video:<strong><strong> </strong></strong>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Interest-over-time-of-CrossFit-v.-Bodybuilding.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1184 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Interest-over-time-of-CrossFit-v.-Bodybuilding-300x176.png\" alt=\"Interest over time of CrossFit v. Bodybuilding\" width=\"300\" height=\"176\" /></a>\n\n<strong><strong> </strong></strong>\n<h3><b>2nd most Risky Training: Crossfit</b></h3>\nThe amount of people doing crossfit now is much higher than the number of people doing bodybuilding.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo just by a numbers game, you are going to see more crossfit injuries because you are drawing from a larger pool of people participating in this style of training.\n\nThe myofascial techniques <a href=\"http://www.t-nation.com/training/4-most-damaging-types-of-training\">outlined here</a> are so kindergarten. Crossfit athletes have a real expert that we look to for advice: Kelly Starett. Most crossfit athletes have a lacrosse ball and a roller to do Myofascial release.\n<h4><b>Average to Elite</b></h4>\nThe simple fact is that crossfit is taking the average Joe and helping them achieve elite fitness.\n\nThe graph above shows the facts. Average people are getting in shape and former collegiate and professional athletes are achieving elite fitness and are competing at a level of fitness that most people will never come close to.\n<h4><b>More Ignorance</b></h4>\nAnother great qoute from your site: “If you insist on losing your gains through light load, high-rep Olympic lifting, make sure to limit some of the trashing your body is about to endure with self-myofascial release. “\n\nYou need to get your facts straight bro. Light load?\n\nWhen was the last time you had a max load on overhead squat. Probably a long time, I took a look at your legs and it looks like you are riding a chicken. Maybe you should skip Bi’s and Tri’s and actually workout your leg muscles. Bro.\n\nThe problem is you have no idea what crossfit actually is. Take your panties off and go step into a gym and see if you handle the heat...SON!\n\n<strong><strong> </strong></strong>\n<h3><b>The most risky training: Running</b></h3>\nOne more graph:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Risk-training-running-v.-crossfit.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1183 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Risk-training-running-v.-crossfit-300x181.png\" alt=\"Running v. bodybuilding popularity\" width=\"300\" height=\"181\" /></a>\n\nAccording to Google, running is substantially more popular than bodybuilding. Even though runners may look like T-rex, they definitely don’t have to worry about the risks mentioned above with bodybuilding.\n\nMy wife is a runner, so I take it back. She doesn’t look like T-rex. You look great princess!\n\nAbout <a href=\"http://www.runnersworld.com/stretching/do-you-stretch-after-running\">40% of runners do NOT stretch</a>. This culture of not stretching after your run can definitely impact your longevity and lead to injuries. This could be a contributing factor in the overall scope of things.\n\nChanging the no-stretching mentality will be the first step to getting runners back out on the road.\n\nRunners need someone like Kelly Starett who can relate to them and show them the benefits of mobility in terms of running, health, and overall performance. Who will step up? Only time will tell.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>What is the REAL Risk</b></h3>\nThe real risk is that you do nothing. Yes, bodybuilding, powerlifting, crossfit, and running all have risks associated with them. But doing nothing is the greatest risk.\n\nOnce you decide how you want to achieve your level of fitness, just look at what will work best for you and what your goals are. Then look at the top athletes in each sport and decide who you want to model.\n\nDon’t listen to self promoting physical therapists who don’t actually know what they are talking about.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4 style=\"color: #444444;\">Featured Image: <a href=\"http://bestbuildmuscleguide.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bestbuildmuscleguid</a>e, <a href=\"http://insidetheboxbook.com\" target=\"_blank\">insidetheboxbook</a>, <a href=\"http://neverstopexploring.com\" target=\"_blank\">neverstopexploring</a></h4>","Slug":"training-risk-analysis","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/everything_crossfit/training-risk-analysis/","Path":"/everything_crossfit/training-risk-analysis/","Date":"2014-09-30","Year":"2014","Month":"09","Day":"30","Categories":"Everything CrossFit","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/For-Blog-1.png | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sean-William-Campbell.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Interest-over-time-of-CrossFit-v.-Bodybuilding.png | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Risk-training-running-v.-crossfit.png | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/B.Chase-BBs.png","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/For-Blog-1.png | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sean-William-Campbell.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Interest-over-time-of-CrossFit-v.-Bodybuilding.png | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Risk-training-running-v.-crossfit.png | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/B.Chase-BBs.png","Image Alt Text":"Fitness training risks | crossfit training | Running v. bodybuilding risks | "},{"id":"1187","Title":"Fat Battle: Finding Omega 3 Rich Foods","Meta Description":"Learn how to incorporate Omega 3 rich foods into your diet and trim bad fats. The benefits to your health and fitness performance improve with these foods.","Content":"Our newfound society has a habit of looking down upon fat consumption within the human diet. It wasn’t until new and further research was conducted that we’ve found that healthy fats are a essential in order for your body to perform at its full potential. Now that the importance of healthy dietary fats is valued within a growing percentage of the educated health and fitness community, we can finally understand and enjoy the benefits of these marvelous dietary fats, particularly Omega fatty acids.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids, are prime sources for the healthy dietary fat your body needs for long-term high function. Studies have measured the mental and physical growth our bodies sustain when provided the nutrient benefits of Omega fatty acids. The impact is tremendous in the right dose.\n\nOften, the biggest argument against dietary fats claims the cost in high calories is not worth ingesting for the nutritional benefits certain fats provide. If you are one to carefully count calories, stop now. The reality is your body will benefit more with proper nourishment than it will by withholding calories from your body. Although the high amounts of calories within these fats have not changed, we now know that the benefits outweigh the 9 calories per gram.\n\nFor your better understanding, N-3 fatty acids (Omega-3’s) are considered polyunsaturated fats, commonly what we call “healthy fats”. These polyunsaturated fats can be primarily found within plants and oils, with benefits that include a decrease in risk for type-2 diabetes, improvement in blood cholesterol levels, cognitive function, and rheumatoid arthritis. The other healthy type of fat is monounsaturated fat, which has the same benefits as polyunsaturated fats but can also decrease your chance of heart disease, benefit insulin levels, and improve blood sugar control. <a href=\"http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/omega3-fatty-acids\">1</a>\n\nOmega-3’s are comprised of two different types of rich fatty acids, the first being alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and the other consists of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). While EPA and DHA can only be found in fatty fish, ALA can be found in multiple sources, like:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Flaxseed (ground or oil)</li>\n\t<li>Walnuts</li>\n\t<li>Canola oil</li>\n\t<li>Soybean</li>\n\t<li>Green Vegetables: Kale, Brussel Sprouts, Spinach</li>\n</ul>\nWhile ALA is partly converted into EPA and DHA within the body, fish provide the pure form of EPA and DHA that can be quickly processed within the body and can maximize absorption. Salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel, sardines, herring, krill, and cod are the best sources of fatty fish for your Omega-3 requirements.\n\nWhile the average American diet consists of large amounts of saturated and trans fats, most people don’t know the effects these two types of fats can have on the body. These two fatty acids are associated with increasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) within the body, otherwise known as “bad” cholesterol.<a href=\"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/54/3/438.short\">2</a>\n\nSaturated fats has been known to raise your blood cholesterol levels, while trans fats will actually lower your high-density lipoproteins (HDL) or “good” cholesterol. While the health benefits of saturated fats is debatable, the combination of these two fats can increase the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.\n\nManage your cholesterol levels by completely ridding trans fats and moderate your intake of saturated fats.\n\nSince omega-3 fatty acids are so crucial to your health, it’s critical that you consume the proper amount of omega 3 rich foods within your diet. Based on a 2,000 calorie a day diet, you will want to consume about 20 to 35 percent of your calories from those healthy fat sources, which comes to around 44 to 78 grams of fat.<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/fat/index.html?s_cid=tw_ob294\">3</a>\n\nIf you are going to count anything, count grams over calories. Those measurements are more reflective of your body’s nutritional needs.\n\nNaturally occurring fatty acids are friendly to your body, but not always to your wallet, so be discerning about which fish oils deliver true unpolluted nutritional value. Athletes and health advocates alike, invest in a quality fatty acid supplement. Finding a solid EPA and DHA derived oil will help you reach those daily requirements, and will push you in the right direction to achieve your health goals.\n<h4>By Michael Dorey  | Featured Image: <a href=\"http://www.crossfitkingofislandpark.com\">Justin Fitzmartin</a></h4>\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Ehrlich, S.D., (June 24, 2013) Omega-3 Fatty Acids: University of Maryland Medical Center.

Beets have a high concentration of nitrates–compounds that increase blood flow to the brain, heart, and muscles.","Content":"Have you been eating your beets? If not, we won't hurt you. However, it might be time to reevaluate and look into what these little maroon monsters have to offer. Beetroot health benefits are impressive and far-reaching. Beets are a great nutritional choice for numerous reasons–from fighting cancer, to providing essential vitamins, and regulating blood pressure–these guys will make your body smile from the inside out.\n\nWhat’s especially magical about beets is that they contain manganese and potassium–which are important for blood-pressure regulation. They also contain vitamin-C, magnesium, iron, copper and phosphorus–essential vitamins and minerals your body needs for proper function.<a href=\"http://www.marksdailyapple.com/beets/#axzz3D7N4h94m%20\">1</a> High blood pressure is a very common health concern. However, it is one that can be addressed through natural means, <i>like beets!</i> They help stabilize your blood pressure and return you back to the healthy range. So, how exactly do they do it?\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJ6V0FC/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=amrapwebsite-20&amp;linkId=2ROBJKQFJQHUULSA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beets</a> have a high concentration of nitrates–compounds that help to increase blood flow to the brain, heart, and muscles. Once nitrate enters your body, it is converted into a powerful gas called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide relaxes the smooth muscles in your blood vessels and helps your arteries stay properly dilated–maximizing blood flow. Nitrate also has an antiplatelet effect that helps prevent blood from thickening and clotting.<a href=\"http://www.drdavidwilliams.com/beet-high-blood-pressure/%20\">2</a>  So what does that mean? It means that these work together to support easier blood flow and may lead to significantly lowered blood pressure. Studies have also found that beets lower systolic blood pressure–the force that drives blood out of the heart–by 4-5 points. While that drop may seem small, when viewed on an overall public health level it would equate to a 10% reduction in deaths due to heart disease.<a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/news/20121212/%20beetroot-juice-blood-pressure\">3</a>  Beets are also awesome for working out. Their organic properties provide your body with long-lasting energy and help to vastly increase stamina–due to their ability to increase your natural blood flow.\n\nYou might not be a huge fan of beets, and to be honest, many of us aren’t. Nevertheless, there are simple and creative ways<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJ6V0FC/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=amrapwebsite-20&amp;linkId=2ROBJKQFJQHUULSA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-5684 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Beet-nitrates2-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a> to incorporate beets into your diet. One of the more common ways is <i>juicing</i>. Throw in some beets and add carrots, cucumbers, apples, and some lemon for a tasty, powerhouse drink. Beets are also beneficial raw or cooked. Slice ‘em up and add them to your favorite salad. Our personal favorite is natural concentrated beetroot supplements, often called Nitric Oxide activators; combine with 8 ounces of water and quickly gulp the nitrate rich benefits of beets.\n\nHowever you decide to get these little guys into your system is up to you, we just hope you can show them some love and get them in your daily diet. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJ6V0FC/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=amrapwebsite-20&amp;linkId=2ROBJKQFJQHUULSA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beets</a> are an excellent addition to a natural regimen to help combat high blood-pressure and increase your daily energy and overall stamina.

Well, when it comes down to it, we’re all human. And, as human beings, we were born runners–the efficiency of our cooling systems and having upright posture maximizes our lung capacity.

We have a very high-energy cost of running.<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/outdoors/sports/physics/animal-kingdom-top-marathon-runners#slide-2\">1</a> We have to train for that endurance. We have to prove to our bodies–through our mind–that we are capable of our anything.\n\nIt’s not impossible. But anything worth anything takes time and sacrifice. Try these 3 tips to turn you into the super-athletes you always knew you could be.\n<ol>\n\t<li>Elevation Runs</li>\n</ol>\nWhen we return to sea level after training in upper elevations, we’re more powerful. We’re significantly stronger. This is due to the increased mass of our ever-looping red blood cells. The effects of elevation training has on our body can include an increase of endurance, reduced recovery time, weight loss, as well as a natural increase in human growth hormones–which stimulates growth and cell reproduction It also increases our overall red blood cell count. More blood in our bodies, means more oxygen for our muscles. Your mitochondria <i>literally</i> improve–this is where your muscle cells get their power. Basically, we get more bang for our buck, letting us work out harder, better, faster, stronger.<a href=\"http://www.mensfitness.com/training/build-muscle/secrets-to-oympic-success-training-at-altitude#sthash.8zZyKFaw.dpuf\">2</a>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n\t<li>Track Sprints</li>\n</ol>\nIf you want to get fit faster and boost your explosive power, adding high-intensity efforts–30-seconds track sprints–will give you impressive results. Plus, it makes you look cool. For those of us who may not have time for long, steady endurance exercises, but want the same–<i>and even better</i>–cardiovascular benefits, consider track sprints for workouts. Quick, high intensity sprint workouts will vastly improve your aerobic capacity and endurance in half the time of traditional endurance exercises, such as long runs.<a href=\"http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/sampleworkouts/a/30sec_sprints.htm%20\">3</a> Alternate timing and running with a training partner–it’s perfect for rests in between your explosive sets. And, a little healthy competition is always fun\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li>Interval Training</li>\n</ol>\nHigh-intensity interval training is extremely helpful. And it’s crazy fun. HIIT consists of insanely intense, short bursts of exercise with active recovery–much less intense exercise, or complete rest in between. Both aerobic-cardio and anaerobic-strength workouts qualify. They will get your heart pumping and fire up your metabolism thanks to the phenomenon known as <i>afterburn–</i>excessive post-exercise oxygen consumption Basically, higher metabolism, more calories burned. Trust me, it’s a good thing. You can get a super effective workout in just 20 minutes or less—even in as few as four minutes if you do–20 seconds high intensity, then 10-seconds low intensity. Push hard and fight through it, then rest and recover.<a href=\"http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/hiit-workout\">4</a>\n\nYou see, improving our running endurance is as easy as 1-2-3. With just a little bit of time and sacrifice geared towards maximizing efficiency, we will see exponential results. Perhaps we can even start winning some races and keep up with the pros. We may not be super-human, but we can at least train like the titans.\n<h4>Featured Image: <a href=\"http://www.outsideonline.com\" target=\"_blank\">Outsideonline.com</a></h4>\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences\n<ol>\n\t<li>Resnick, Brian (2014, September). <i>The Animal Kingdom’s Top Marathoners</i>.

If you push yourself and work your ass off, then the WOD will be challenging, and that’s how you know you’re giving it your all. But, if you’re constantly feeling like you just don’t have “enough to give”, then you’ll want to make some improvements to the areas listed above. You may need to take some time away from the gym, so that you can focus on making your habits more healthy and sustainable. Mental training for CrossFit athletes is equally important to physical training; give your whole body needed attention. After you've regained some energy, you'll feel much better about attacking your workouts and you'll likely see more results!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured Image By: <a href=\"http://fitbandits.com\" target=\"_blank\">FitBandits</a></h4>","Slug":"6-areas-assess-youre-regularly-tired-wods","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/everything_crossfit/6-areas-assess-youre-regularly-tired-wods/","Path":"/everything_crossfit/6-areas-assess-youre-regularly-tired-wods/","Date":"2014-10-20","Year":"2014","Month":"10","Day":"20","Categories":"Everything CrossFit | Health Tips","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kettlebell_tired_crossfit_wod.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kettlebell_tired_crossfit_wod.jpg","Image Alt Text":"tired after cross fit WOD"},{"id":"1270","Title":"Start Getting Serious, and You'll See Results.","Meta Description":"What the Paleo Diet and Weight Watchers app taught me about weight control and food. I sweat off a record amount of weight in 2 1/2 years, and still going.","Content":"“Once you start getting serious, you start seeing results.” I heard a version of this quote from someone at my last Weight Watchers meeting, and I feel as though it parallels so many different situations in life. If you commit to something, you will see progress as a result of hard work. I learned this the hard way two and a half years ago when I realized that I would have to “get serious” if I really wanted to make a change in my life.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was your stereotypical overweight girl before I finally decided to take the reins on my life. Along with teetering on the morbidly obese BMI sector, I was also experiencing high blood pressure and a low HDL count (the type of cholesterol you want to have a high level of because it helps you fight heart disease). I was not, by any means, physically fit. Of course I had the typical “fitness stints” in my life that never lasted more than six months at a time. Not only were my genes not on my side, but my mind was not on my side either. I relied on food for comfort, for stability, and for love; unfortunately, what I got in return was slowly wreaking havoc on my body at the youthful age of 21. What I ate in private certainly showed in public, and I was neither happy nor proud of that fact.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFast-forward to two and a half years ago, when a conversation with my doctor about my health issues really resonated with me. I was only 21 years old and already experiencing health concerns that are typically seen among the older population. I did not want to continue living my life for food; I wanted to live my life for LIFE. I finally decided to make the change and “get serious” about losing weight, so I joined Weight Watchers in 2012. To date, I have lost over 100 pounds by changing my diet and my lifestyle. I am an active gym-goer and runner. I have run multiple 5Ks and love the feeling of success I get from completing each one. I have gone from not feeling confident in my own skin, losing my breath at the simplest of tasks, and avoiding any activity that required physical effort to finally beginning to feel confident in who I am, finding my strength through pushing myself physically, and enjoying my life with the people I love and care about. Not only do I hope to serve as an inspiration and motivation to the important people in my life, but I hope to serve as a role model for anyone who is struggling with losing weight, because I truly believe that if I can overcome my biggest demon, anyone can.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter losing the amount of weight that I have and learning and adapting a completely new lifestyle, I knew that it was time to share my thoughts and ideas with the world, which is why I started blogging. You can check out my personal blog at <a href=\"http://www.cake-sweat.com\">Cake Sweat</a>, where I post my struggles, my successes, and everything in-between. I always appreciate any and all support I get from my readers, and I hope to support them in the same way. If you’d like to learn more about my story, I’d love it if you’d give it a read!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis may seem like a fairy-tale success, but two and a half years on the same program can get boring, especially if you’re me. I had been tracking so long that it was becoming redundant, and I was no longer seeing the changes that I had wanted to see as far as my weight loss goals were concerned. I constantly thrive for new, exciting, and different, and at this point in my life, I was ready for a change. I knew I still wanted to be a Weight Watcher, but I wanted to try something new. I wasn’t losing any more weight; I was in the dreaded rut phase where my body was riding a roller coaster of gains and losses. I could feel my motivation slipping, and that’s when I knew it was time to try something else.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter doing some research on the Paleo diet, I wanted to try it for myself. However, I was still toying with the idea because I wasn’t sure if I was ready to commit to a lifestyle free of processed foods. Our fast-paced world can make it extremely difficult to maintain a processed-free lifestyle, especially when people are always looking for convenience and speed; food choices being no different. I wasn’t sure if I would be successful, and I was a little hesitant to plunge right in. Fate stepped in when I saw a post online for a Paleo 30-day challenge group, and I took that as a sign. I would try the Paleo diet.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor 30 days, I was strict Paleo. I really loved how it seemed to be the perfect marriage of two lifestyles: Paleo and Weight Watchers. With Paleo, I was being taught what types of foods to eat while being able to still maintain appropriate, healthy, portion-controlled meals through the Weight Watchers program. It was a perfect balance of healthy choices and smart sizes. I would still be able to use my Weight Watchers “app” and resources to determine the right amount of food, and utilize the basics of the Paleo diet to figure out what foods would be the best choices for me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMeal planning was important for me when doing Paleo, mainly because I knew that it was going to be difficult to figure out what foods I needed to eliminate from my diet that I was so used to having. I have to give up my beloved Chobani? I wasn’t too happy about that! Needless to say, grocery shopping and meal prepping was not something I looked forward to in the beginning. I never really knew just how processed everything is until reading about this diet. While on the diet, I used <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Paleo-Customized-Whole-Foods-Lifestyle/dp/1936608758\"><em>Practical Paleo</em></a> by Diane Sanfilipo as a guide. This book is an easy read, and even provides tear-out guides to all things Paleo so you can have the foundation at your fingertips. I highly suggest using this book if you are considering the Paleo lifestyle. It lays out the plan so that you can start it right away without having to spend a lot of time reading up on it beforehand.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere were a lot of benefits that I reaped from the diet. I definitely noticed a change in my sugar levels. I am occasionally prone to bouts of light-headedness, particularly during periods of time that I fluctuate between eating raw versus processed foods. The Paleo diet eliminated most of that feeling, simply due to the fact that I had cut out almost all processed foods entirely. Another benefit came from my doctor. While only two and a half weeks on the program, I had a yearly physical with my doctor, who had said that my triglyceride level (a test that determines the level of your LDL, which is what determines whether you have high cholesterol) was low, which is ideal. My triglyceride level was at 45 MG, while a normal level is less than 100 MG. She had said that it was rare for her to see a patient’s level this low, and that it was probably due to my elimination of processed foods. It was definitely a shock; I knew that processed foods wreak havoc on your body, but I didn’t realize how much my body was affected by it until this appointment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere were some times that I may have gotten off-plan during those 30 days, and I say “may” because I’m honestly not sure. Sometimes it’s so difficult to control your food environment that you just have to try your best and hope you’re doing it right. Many times I questioned my food when I went out to eat. Going out to eat is not typically recommended on the Paleo diet, but I did it anyways. I just made sure to read the menu, ask questions, and attempt to get my food as plainly prepared as possible. When in doubt, ask for gluten-free options. Be prepared for some strange looks from the waiters when asking for specific ingredients of certain dishes—it's like they think you’re trying to steal their recipes or something!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs much as I loved the lifestyle as a whole, I knew that it wasn’t something I could fully commit to 100% of the time for the rest of my life. I still follow many of the guidelines on the Paleo diet, but I’ve learned to incorporate it into my own lifestyle that works for me. I still eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, and I try to consume protein sources through eggs, chicken, and seafood. If I do buy processed foods, I try to buy gluten-free as often as possible, with as little ingredients on the label as I can find. (On a sidenote-I am a huge fan of the Enjoy Life products for gluten-free options, especially their chocolate chips. Talk about an indulgence without the guilt!) I also try to stay away from any processed fat and dairy, such as margarine and skim milk, and stick to butter and almond milk if I’m looking for substitutions. Even though the full commitment isn’t for me, the core ideas behind the Paleo diet have really taught me how to properly fuel my body.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSince this was a total lifestyle change for me, I had to find creative ways to make some of the foods that I loved “Paleo-approved.” I’m a dessert girl at heart, so of course I had to find ways to get in a little sweet treat every once in a while!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere’s a recipe for one of my quick and easy desserts, and I think it pairs well with the change of season and the availability of this delicious fruit!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Paleo Apple Crumble</strong></span>\n<img src=\"http://i58.tinypic.com/2wel6s3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"214\" height=\"286\" />\n\nIngredients:\n<ul>\n\t<li>1-2 apples, peeled and diced</li>\n\t<li>2 tablespoons Bob’s Red Mill Organic, High-Fiber Coconut Flour</li>\n\t<li>1-2 tablespoons water</li>\n\t<li>Cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar to taste</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nDirections:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Place the apples in a microwave-safe bowl.</li>\n\t<li>Microwave on high for two minutes.</li>\n\t<li>Take the bowl out of the microwave and stir the apples.</li>\n\t<li>Microwave on high for another two minutes.</li>\n\t<li>While it is microwaving the second time, place the coconut flour and one tablespoon of the water in a bowl.

See five quick reasons honey tops the list of the best workout recovery foods plus meal ideas.","Content":"<h2>Honey: The heavyweight champion for natural packed workout recovery.</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"color: #808080;\">“Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.” Nothing threw a right cross or a punchy quote like Muhammad Ali. The best in his boxing game, and built rhyming fame, his words had a sting, and he was unbeatable in the ring. Apparently he loved bees as much as boxing and poetry. Ali knew it, and so do we–honey is money. Raw honey happens to be one of the single best foods an athlete can take for a natural food-based workout recovery.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"color: #808080;\">Why raw honey? Commercial honey is heavily processed and may even have been chemically refined. Excessive heat destroys the natural enzymes, vitamins, and minerals in honey. Filtering/processing eliminates many of the beneficial phytonutrients including pollen and enzyme-rich propolis. Avoid the golden syrup-like honey in favor of opaque organic raw honey.<a style=\"color: #808080;\" href=\"http://draxe.com/the-many-health-benefits-of-raw-honey/\">1</a> Raw honey is the most original sweet liquid that honeybees produce from the concentrated nectar of flowers.

Here’s five quick reasons for your honey pot.</span>\n<ol>\n\t<li><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Makes great workout fuel: Raw honey is an excellent source of energy because it comes with superior nutrients. The National Honey Board recommends adding honey to your bottle of water for a workout energy boost. Honey-snacks can be eaten before and after, even honey-sticks can be consumed during endurance events.<a style=\"color: #808080;\" href=\"http://www.mnn.com/health/fitness-well-being/stories/10-health-benefits-of-honey\">3</a></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Treats wounds: In numerous studies, honey has been found effective in treating wounds. It is uniquely low in moisture and extremely acidic, making it a forbidding environment for bacteria and microorganisms. On top of that, bees add an enzyme, glucose oxidase, to it that creates hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct. Antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and has remarkable debriding action.<a style=\"color: #808080;\" href=\"http://www.mnn.com/health/fitness-well-being/stories/10-health-benefits-of-honey\">3</a></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Provides nutrients: Honey contains “small amounts of a wide array of vitamins and minerals, including niacin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.” Thus, using honey instead of sugar provides you with more nutrients for your calories.<a style=\"color: #808080;\" href=\"http://www.mnn.com/health/fitness-well-being/stories/10-health-benefits-of-honey\">3</a></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Helps you lose weight: Drinking, with warm water, lemon and honey is a top component every detox programs. Doing this on the daily also helps cleanse the liver, remove toxins, and flushing away fat.<a style=\"color: #808080;\" href=\"http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-8743/6-delicious-health-benefits-of-honey.html\">4</a></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Reduces the risk of heart disease: Honey mixed with cinnamon has been shown to revitalize the arteries and veins of the heart and reduce cholesterol in the blood by up to 10%. When taken on a regular basis, this honey-cinnamon mixture may significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks.<a style=\"color: #808080;\" href=\"http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-8743/6-delicious-health-benefits-of-honey.html\">4</a></span></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"color: #808080;\">So, the next time you're in need to feed your sweet tooth, choose honey before sugar. It’s an easy substitute. Honey can be twice as sweet and thrice as healthy. Honey has an entire hive of yummy uses. In your day-to-day cooking, it can be used in marinades–meats such as chicken or duck, and pork chops. It can be tossed into smoothies and even salad dresses. Plop it in your your tea or breakfast yoghurt. Drizzle it over thin slices of cheese as deliciously sweet and salty end to meals. Add tablespoons of honey with raw cinnamon to warm water, drink daily.<a style=\"color: #808080;\" href=\"http://health-benefits-honey-and-tips-incorporate-honey-your-cooking\">5</a></span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"color: #808080;\">The overall bee-nefitts: A Lot of honey is available on the market, but not all of them have the same healthy attributes. For optimal nutrition and performance–make raw honey your best, only option. Honey raw–unheated and organic–means it contains vitamins, minerals, enzymes, antioxidants and all of the precious insulin-type substances.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"color: #808080;\">Heated and filtered honey is turned into pure sucrose, which loses a majority of its nutritional value and healing benefits. “All the honey in the world is nothing without the confirmation of the bees.” Honey is money.

While many of these have come and gone-- one deserves to stay. Egg white protein powder is the original shake that athletes and fitness gurus alike have harnessed before the development of whey and casein protein in the 90’s. Many still consider egg whites to be the “perfect protein”.<a href=\"http://www.buzzle.com/articles/egg-white-protein-vs-whey-protein.html\">1</a>\n\nWith a little over three grams of protein per egg white, you are able to consume one of the purest forms of protein available in the human diet. An individual cage-free egg contains about ⅔ of its mass from the protein albumin, the rest being the yolk. Albumin contains several types of protein, all of which are responsible for different functions such as nourishment, blocking digestive enzymes, binding iron, binding vitamins; as well as providing the essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids.\n\nWhen separating the white from the yolk you are ridding much of the high concentration of fats and cholesterol contained in the yolk that can give you those added calories you may not desire. Still, many would argue that the body performs better with a full nutritional profile received in the yolk. From experience, athletes understand that one egg (yolk included) is just not enough for their high protein demands. Most need additional protein to supplement their food intake. By providing yourself with a high quality egg white protein powder you can get around 25 grams of protein in just a 30 gram scoop. Lactose free products are in rising demand and as egg white protein has zero lactose, fat, cholesterol, and minimal carbs it is a productive supplement option for athletes.<a href=\"http://www.nutritionexpress.com/article+index/authors/mark+g+taylor+ms/showarticle.aspx?articleid=896\">2</a> In the world of protein powder, egg-white promotes the same performance boost and lean muscle mass to those athletes with strict dietary needs.\n\nNow, protein powders rule the supplement industry as we know it, with whey and casein becoming the primary sources. These two dairy based proteins being much less costly, as well as coming in a wide variety of flavors have made them the popular choice amongst consumers. But little do many know that they can contain vast amounts of artificial flavors, colors, and preservatives-- plus random chemicals.<a href=\"http://www.nutritionexpress.com/article+index/authors/mark+g+taylor+ms/showarticle.aspx?articleid=896\">2</a>\n\nEvery supplement has a possible downside, with some egg white proteins having one. That problem is the non-use of pasteurization. Pasteurization commonly rids most harmful organisms that may be held by the eggs themselves, such as salmonella. Free-range and hormone free chicken eggs are always the safest bet when consuming them in either cooked or powdered forms to decrease the likelihood of health risks. When egg whites are cooked they are nearly a perfect source of protein, but when consumed unpasteurized or uncooked the protein avidin binds with available biotin within the body to create a large array of health issues.<a href=\"http://superhumancoach.com/pros-and-cons-of-egg-protein-powder/\">3</a>\n\nTo enhance the effects, try cooking or baking with the egg white protein powder to increase healthy protein intake. <i>AMRAP Nutrition </i>has established this with growth-hormone free chicken eggs, and deriving their egg white protein powder from these quality sources. Every individual bar contains almost 15 grams of cooked/pasteurized egg white protein powder, with various amounts of other vital ingredients to increase your health.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured Image:<a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/481383-what-are-the-benefits-of-egg-white-protein-powder/\" target=\"_blank\"> Livestrong.com</a></h4>\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>References </strong>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Johnson, P.

Understand better alternatives to replace grain that are heavily processed.","Content":"Albert Einstein believed, “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” It’s about going against the grain. Trading up mediocrity, the ordinary for the extraordinary. Thinking against the grain is the first step. The next is acting upon it. Understand better alternatives to replace grain.\n\nThe traditional American diet is heavy on grains. Can you blame us–pastas, pizza, cereal, oatmeal, pretzels, rice–these foods are delicious–they’re good, not great. You are what you eat. Gluten-free may be a fad, but Paleo isn’t. It’s been around for well….since human beings have. The Paleo diet is derived from the Paleolithic era, before the Neolithic era–the beginning of the agricultural revolution.\n\nGrain is basically any food made from agronomy and cultivation–wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley, and cereal grain. And, bread, pasta, oatmeal, breakfast cereals, tortillas, and grits are examples of grain products. Grains are divided into two subgroups, whole and refined.\n\nWhole grains contain the entire grain kernel, the bran, germ, and endosperm. Examples: whole-wheat flour, bulgur, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, brown rice. Refined grains have been milled, a process that removes the bran and germ. This is done to give grains a finer texture and improve their shelf life, but it also removes dietary fiber, iron, and many B vitamins. Examples: white flour, cornmeal, white bread, white rice.<a href=\"http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/grains.html\">1</a>\n<h4>Benefits from reducing grain intake:</h4>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Grains Aren’t Good For Your Joints. Due to their inflammatory nature grains are linked to joint pain and arthritis. Because both synovial tissue and grains are chemically similar, your body has difficulty differentiating between the two. So, when your immune cells get bent out of shape by inflammation caused by grain and begin to attack it as a foreign invader, they also begin to attack the soft tissue in your joint since the grain’s amino acid composition mirrors that of the soft tissue in your joints. This may leading painful autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and, of course, more inflammation.<a href=\"https://healthunlocked.com/diabetesindia/posts/1116387/pros-and-cons-of-whole-grains........-whole-grains-a-myth\">2</a></li>\n\t<li>Grains cause inflammation: Due to high starch content, grains are inflammatory foods. The more refined the grain, the more inflammatory it is. Chronic inflammation is linked to modern diseases: arthritis, allergies, asthma, cardiovascular disease, bone loss, emotional imbalance and even cancer.<a href=\"https://healthunlocked.com/diabetesindia/posts/1116387/pros-and-cons-of-whole-grains........-whole-grains-a-myth\">2</a></li>\n\t<li>Grains can prevent mineral absorption: When improperly prepared they can inhibit vitamin and mineral absorption. Grains contain substances like phytic acid, which binds up minerals and prevents adequate absorption. Essentially, though your diet might be rich in iron, calcium and other vital nutrients if you consume too much grain, you’re not fully absorbing nutrients from the foods you eat.<a href=\"https://healthunlocked.com/diabetesindia/posts/1116387/pros-and-cons-of-whole-grains........-whole-grains-a-myth\">2</a></li>\n\t<li>Grains aren’t good for your skin: Grains have a high carbohydrate content. Although they’re complex carbs, they are still broken down into sugars. These sugars instruct your body to produce more insulin elevated insulin leading to hormonal responses that activate glands in your skin–encouraging them to produce oil, which leads to acne.<a href=\"https://healthunlocked.com/diabetesindia/posts/1116387/pros-and-cons-of-whole-grains........-whole-grains-a-myth\">2</a></li>\n\t<li>Some more nutritional alternatives to grain: Quinoa. It’s complete protein that offers a respectable serving of all nine essential amino acids as well as a strong showing of manganese, magnesium, iron, copper and phosphorus.<a href=\"http://www.marksdailyapple.com/alternatives-to-grains-quinoa/#axzz356pklpT23\">3</a></li>\n</ul>\nSquashes and sweet potatoes, both nutrient loaded, can serve as a respectable grain alternative. Likewise, lower glycemic beans such lentils can be a decent fill-in.\n\nEggplant, an ingredient that takes on the flavor of any sauce you make. Eggplant slices can serve as substitutes for pizza crust, and bread sticks.<a href=\"http://www.marksdailyapple.com/alternatives-to-grains-quinoa/#axzz356pklpT23\">3</a>\n\nMushrooms can offer the warm, pleasantly mild taste that we might crave from grains. Crustless quiches work too. Strips of cabbage and spaghetti squash can serve as a “pasta” for both light and meaty sauces.<a href=\"http://www.marksdailyapple.com/alternatives-to-grains-quinoa/#axzz356pklpT23\">3</a>\n\nEinstein was a pretty smart guy. Thinking outside the box and against the grain served him rather nicely–as well as the rest of us. If we want to be serious about our health, we not be conscious of it. Let’s defreat the wheat. We can be ordinary, or we can discipline ourselves to be extraordinary. The key to peak physical form isn’t how many rounds we can go in the gym, but how much health we can put into our bodies. it’s Remember, “We can not solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them.\"-Einstein\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured Image: www.theironyou.com</h4>\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences\n<ol>\n\t<li>Department of Agriculture (2014, Oct 3). <i>What Foods Are In The Grains Group? </i>Retrieved from: <a href=\"http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/grains.html\">http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/grains.html</a></li>\n\t<li>Health Unlocked (2014, Oct 3). <i>Pros And Cons Of Whole Grains…Whole Grains A Myth?</i> Retrieved from: <a href=\"https://healthunlocked.com/diabetesindia/posts/1116387/pros-and-cons-of-whole-grains........-whole-grains-a-myth\">https://healthunlocked.com/diabetesindia/posts/1116387/pros-and-cons-of-whole-grains........-whole-grains-a-myth</a></li>\n\t<li>Sisson, Mark (2014, July 3). <i>Reader Response: Alternatives To Grains?

The paleo lifestyle not only includes eating healthy at home but includes a healthy travel routine of diet and exercise. Many who have adopted a paleo lifestyle keep a paleo travel or gluten-free travel regiment in when they are out of town, whether for business or pleasure. While these healthy living routines have great benefits for health and longevity, if you’re not exercising somewhat regularly, you may be missing out on a key way to keep encroaching pain away.\n\nNot only does <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/weight-loss-fitness/exercise-and-paleo/\">exercise</a> improve your <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/weight-loss-fitness/paleo-for-athletes/\">muscle tone</a> and help you maintain a healthy weight, making you look great in your jeans, bikini, halter top or tanks (men!), it offers important health benefits, decreases your chances of developing serious health conditions such as osteoporosis and cancer, and can lengthen your life span. It’s important for us all to understand the benefits of exercise in our overall physical and mental well-being and how it’s easy to get started on implementing a routine that can be adhered to.\n\nProbably what drives people to exercise and crossfit more than any other reason is weight control and looks, but what about HEALTH! Studies show that overweight women are more likely to develop serious health risks such as heart disease, cancers, and stroke. Men need this to keep hormones balanced and the heart in tip-top shape.\n\nBy using up oxygen and causing the body to burn some stored fat (increasing the metabolism), exercise can help you get that healthy lean look that is so appealing to many people these days, but along with BEING EVEN MORE HEALTHY. Furthermore, exercise, by strengthening muscles, increases your metabolic rate, allowing you to burn more calories and FAT, and we all love to see that melt off with ease, or hard work.\n\nStudies estimate that for each pound of muscle you add to your body, you will burn an additional thirty-five to fifty calories per day; <strong>an extra five pounds of muscle will burn about 175-250 calories a day, or an extra pound of fat every two to three weeks, or about twenty pounds a year.</strong> This explains why men burn calories faster and lose weight more easily than women; they have more muscle mass, which allows them to burn more calories. The benefits are more than rewarding the more we gravitate to muscle mass as opposed to JUST fat loss and working towards strengthening our skeletal system, while enhancing the beautiful body we have now; all with the health benefits well in mind.\n\nAnother healthy benefit of regular exercise is stronger bones. Regular, moderate exercise, in particularly weight-bearing exercises such as dancing, crossfit, fast walking, running, and jogging, as well as resistance training (strength-training or again crossfit) increases bone mass, making them stronger. This makes those who exercise on a regular basis less likely to develop osteoporosis and arthritis and suffer debilitating accidents such as falling, while helping you to stay active and graceful as you age.\n\nExercise can also help women deal with stress better and improve their mood. Studies show that regular exercise reduces the release of stress <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/weight-loss-fitness/hormones-and-paleo/\">hormones</a>, keeping the heart pumping at a comfortable rate, blood vessels relaxed, and blood pressure low. It also produces chemical changes which affect your mood, reducing symptoms of depression and other psychological disorders. Research suggests that lower stress levels and a happier mood boosts immune function and lengthens the life span significantly. Hey men, listen to that! Now who wants an unhappy, hormone wild woman?\n\nAnother great benefit is better skin. Dull, wrinkled skin is a tell-tale sign of your age. Luckily, exercise can improve complexion by increasing circulation, the delivery of nutrients, and detoxification of skin-dulling poisons. As it boosts oxygen to the skin, it increases the natural production of collagen, the connective tissue you’ve probably heard a lot about as it is responsible for giving your skin its youthful plumpness. Skin color also evens out and improves due to the increased blood circulation. Having that teenage glow in your 20’s, 30’s, 40’s and beyond. Along with a paleo diet that works for you, you will have the skin you should have. The formula for this is really terribly easy.\n\nAs you can see, there are many ways to gain from exercise. So how do you get started? Stay on course and make it a priority. No matter your age or your fitness level, you can get started now and soon see your work pay off.\n\nRemember, though, to check with your doctor before starting an exercise regime if you’re currently experiencing any health conditions or if you have a concern.\n\nThe benefits of exercise are clear. Not only will it allow you to live a longer life with a lower risk of serious health concerns, but it will increase your quality of life as you find yourself happier, more energetic, better-looking, and less stressed out.\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>Featured image by:<a title=\"Marco Corp Travel\" href=\"http://www.themarcocorporation.ca/marcohome/index.cfm?page=travel&amp;leftnav=travel1413153135677310\" target=\"_blank\"> The Marco Corporation</a></h4>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;","Slug":"guarantee-quality-life","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/health_tips/guarantee-quality-life/","Path":"/health_tips/guarantee-quality-life/","Date":"2014-10-13","Year":"2014","Month":"10","Day":"13","Categories":"Health Tips | Lifestyle Design","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/quality-of-life_marcocorp.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/quality-of-life_marcocorp.jpg","Image Alt Text":"Paleo friendly travel"},{"id":"1331","Title":"The Paleolithic Diet: Paleo Foods for Athletes","Meta Description":"Eating paleo promotes lean, healthy muscle growth.

I was in a part of the world that was once conquered by Alexander the Great. Where my mountain vistas turned into the Himalayas and the world’s greatest soldiers fought like ancient warriors with herculean strength. It was the Memorial Day ‘Murph Challenge’–a grueling WOD–in honor of Lt. Michael Murphy, a fallen Navy SEAL and posthumous Medal of Honor recipient.\n<ul>\n\t<li>1-mile run</li>\n\t<li>100 pull-ups</li>\n\t<li>200 push-ups</li>\n\t<li>300 squats</li>\n\t<li>1-mile run</li>\n\t<li>(Wearing 20 lb. vest or body armor)</li>\n</ul>\nMy first WOD introduced me to the crazy-awesome world of crossfit. Where modern everyday athletes with incredible passion and endurance get fit and have fun along the way. Shortly after this, I started hearing about this wild diet fad that everybody was talking about: Paleo. <i>What the heck is Paleo?</i>\n\nPaleolithic “Paleo” diets include ingredients our human ancestors were eating for thousands of years. They ate real, whole, unprocessed foods that they had hunted for and gathered. More recently in human evolution, we've come into the Neolithic period–where farming and numerous technological and chemical advancements have changed the human diet and became detrimental to our health. It was “in many ways a catastrophe from which we have never recovered…the worst mistake in the history of the human race.”<a href=\"http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/paleodietcavemandiet/p/paleodietintro.htm\">1</a> Exaggeration? Maybe. However, when the <i>Neolithic </i>diet came into our sapien race, so did overpopulation, autoimmune diseases, and obesity–all cloaked by centuries of poor eating habits.\n\nPaleo may sound like a fad. It’s not. You could argue that it’s really just the reverse–on the millennial timescale of evolutionary history, agriculture advancements are actually more of a <i>fad</i>.<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/28/stone-soup\">2</a>\n\nThe Paleo diet consists of “meats, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds, and probably ought to include human flesh–however, we don't advise this.\n\n–Cavemen Ate Some of This:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Meats: Beef, lamb, chicken, turkey, pork</li>\n\t<li>Fish/Seafood: Salmon, trout, haddock, shrimp, shellfish</li>\n\t<li>Eggs: Free-range, pastured eggs</li>\n\t<li>Vegetables: Broccoli, kale, peppers, onions, carrots, tomatoes</li>\n\t<li>Fruits: Apples, bananas, oranges, pears, avocados, strawberries, blueberries</li>\n\t<li>Nuts/Seeds: Almonds, macadamia, walnuts, hazelnuts, sunflower/pumpkin seeds</li>\n\t<li>Healthy Fats/Oils: Lard, tallow, coconut oil, olive oil, avocado oil</li>\n\t<li>Salt/Spices: Sea salt, garlic, turmeric, rosemary<a href=\"http://nomnompaleo.com/paleo101\">3</a></li>\n</ul>\n–Cavemen Did Not Eat Much of This:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Sugar/High Fructose Corn Syrup: Soft drinks, juices, sugar, pastries, ice cream</li>\n\t<li>Grains: Breads, pastas, wheat, spelt, rye, barley</li>\n\t<li>Legumes: Beans, lentils, potatoes</li>\n\t<li>Dairy: Milk, cheese</li>\n\t<li>Vegetable Oils: Soybean, sunflower, cottonseed, grapeseed, and corn oil</li>\n\t<li>Trans Fats: Margerine, processed foods, hydrogenated oils</li>\n\t<li>Processed Foods: Laneled diet/low-fat, etc.<a href=\"http://authoritynutrition.com/paleo-diet-meal-plan-and-menu/\">4</a></li>\n</ul>\nThe Paleolithic diet has been around for thousands of years. We gotten sidetracked with agricultural advancements and processed foods for a while, but we’re getting back on track. Eating paleo promotes lean, healthy muscle growth. Paleo foods for athletes is an investment in performance and long term health. From club-wielding cavemen to Crossfit enthusiasts, its nutritional value has benefitted us with the the strength to endure herculean challenges from hunting wooly mammoths to fighting like Navy SEALs.

Whether you’re the enthusiastic 5-mile daily runner, or the max press specialist who’s all about the weight—you too can benefit from the other side. With certain performance benefits being provided from both sides, getting a mix of the two can make you one of the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nStrength can be defined as the ability to resist being moved or broken by force. Endurance is the act, quality, or power of withstanding hardship or stress. So if you’re an individual who can’t jog to the end of the driveway, or lift the milk jug back to the top shelf, now’s the time to switch-up your training regime.

Muscular endurance is related to both cardiovascular endurance and muscular strength, and is utilized by athletes all over the world.\n\nThe muscles are affected by this type of training in a different fashion than most other methods, by primarily developing your slow twitch muscle fibers, as well as improving your fast twitch muscle fibers. Slow twitch fibers are fit for low levels of force over relatively long periods of time. They are much more resistant to fatigue than our fast twitch fibers. Though the time required to generate force is much greater in slow-twitch fibers. <a href=\"http://fitness.dixie.edu/readings/1088/1088_3.pdf\">1</a>\n\nThere is a level of F.I.T.T. (frequency, intensity, type, time) where a training effect will take place. With that being said, this applies to two types of muscular endurance: dynamic endurance and the other static endurance. Dynamic endurance is a muscles ability to contract and relax repeatedly, represented by the number of repetitions you can carry out on a particular body movement in a given time frame. A better way to describe this in relation to muscles is the common formula of lower total resistance and a higher repetition count.\n\nThere is an overload principle that states that physiological adaptations to exercise occur when individuals subject their body to demands greater than what the body’s already adapted to. Static endurance is a muscle’s ability to remain contracted for a long period of time. But for a static muscular approach you must apply the overload principle by increasing the length of time the muscles remain contracted against that force or resistance.<a href=\"http://fitness.dixie.edu/readings/1088/1088_3.pdf\">1</a>\n\nBy incorporating these two types of muscular conditioning  you can increase your endurance and strength to apply to your athletic career or every day life. Many ways to get a great start is to find a workout plan that implements high-rep low weight/ high weight low-rep methods such as crossfit, or a sports specific routine.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured Image By: <a href=\"http://crossfitarbor.com\" target=\"_blank\">Arbor CrossFit</a></h4>\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences\n<ol>\n\t<li>Dixie State University (September, 2014), Muscular Endurance <a href=\"http://fitness.dixie.edu/readings/1088/1088_3.pdf\">http://fitness.dixie.edu/readings/1088/1088_3.pdf</a></li>\n</ol>","Slug":"build-muscular-endurance-counts","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/build-muscular-endurance-counts/","Path":"/interesting_other/build-muscular-endurance-counts/","Date":"2014-10-08","Year":"2014","Month":"10","Day":"08","Categories":"Interesting Other","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/C2B-Masters-Games-2012.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/C2B-Masters-Games-2012.jpg","Image Alt Text":"C2B Masters Games 2012"},{"id":"1336","Title":"3 Easy and Inexpensive DIY Paleo Bars","Meta Description":"Paleo doesn't have to be time consuming.

Make it your hardest workout of the day. (Passing rates are as low as 35% ladies and gents.)","Content":"<h2>No Easy Day. This Workout is All or Nothing.</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nWe all know who Navy SEALs are. They are the ghost and the darkness, the elite warriors that our country calls upon to go to the cold, dark places where the bad things live. The SEAL motto is this: “The only easy day was yesterday.” Meaning everyday they push themselves harder than the day before. There is no easy day girls or guys; it's a continuous grind. And they're not the only ones who live for the grind.\n\nOver the last decade, CrossFit has become deeply rooted into SEAL culture. Go ahead and ask David Werner of Crossfit Seattle (davidatcrossfitseattle.com)  for his Benchmark workout of the day (WOD): Helen, btw. It's game on with CrossFit's high intensity training. Among the Hero WODS like my personal favorite, the Murph Challenge, I like to occasionally throw in some more SEAL exercises for a little bit of \"fun\", it's an exciting challenge.\n\nHere’s the physical screening test for SEAL candidates. Make it one of the hardest WODs you do this week and see if you can compare with the soldiers who train for a living. (Passing rates are as low as 35% ladies and gents.)\n\nPhysical Screen Test:\n<ul>\n\t<li>500-Yard Swim, 10 Minute Rest</li>\n\t<li>Max Push-Ups in 2 Minutes, 2 Minute rest</li>\n\t<li>Max Sit-Ups in 2 Minutes, 2 Minute rest</li>\n\t<li>Max Pull-Ups in 2 Minutes, 10 Minute Rest</li>\n\t<li>1.5 Mile Run</li>\n</ul>\nRequired Pass Times:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Swim 12:30</li>\n\t<li>Push-Ups 50</li>\n\t<li>Sit-Ups 50</li>\n\t<li>Pull Ups 10</li>\n\t<li>1.5 Mile Run 10:30</li>\n</ul>\nKeep this quote in mind when you feel like you want to vomit. It’s part of the SEAL Creed, their Ethos: “I lead by example in all situations. I will never quit. I persevere and thrive on adversity. My Nation expects me to be physically harder and mentally stronger than my enemies. If knocked down, I will get back up, every time.” It's this kind of thinking that drives success. Of course, I shouldn't have to say this but I will. <em>Know your limits</em>, but push towards them as fiercely as possible. So, maybe you're not a Navy SEAL, you can at least train like one. \"Push 'em out.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured Image By: <a href=\"http://www.boxrox.com/scene/2013/03/the-all-or-nothing-mindset-how-to-avoid-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Boxrox.com</a></h4>\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences\n\n1.

When you’re forced to sit down for eight hours or more a day then surrounded by a majority of fast food restaurants giving you thousands of calories in one meal, the result is predictable and inevitable.\n\nWhen your daily routine is structured such as this, its imperative that you take full advantage of every opportunity possible in order to keep active and improve your health. Starting with taking a little time to prepare meals or find alternative healthy food sources, you can get one step closer to beating the sedentary lifestyle.\n\nWhile your probably going to be without any significant equipment to help you out through the workday, one piece that can greatly benefit you is the exercise ball. Probably costing you ten to twenty dollars, you can feel good spending this minimum amount to help you work you core and posture throughout each day. By making sure the ball itself fits you and your desk size, you can implement small amounts of activity with your newfound “perfect posture”. Putting your toes under the leg of your desk or small cabinet, you can perform a few sit-ups every ten minutes while never leaving your desk chair. <b>2</b>\n\nBefore hitting the desk you can add a few routines to help increase activity throughout your day. Parking in the back of the employee parking lot not only decreases the chance of a car door dinging your car, it also allows you to add steps in a small way that will pay off after days or weeks of work. One more strategy is to ditch the convenience of the elevator and take the stairs, whether you’re on the second floor or the seventh. Beginning your day with this little activity can have huge effects after years of the cubicle job.\n\nNow that your seated in your new exercise ball at your desk, and got those extra 100 steps, you can start to change a few things around the office to suit your needs. Putting the stapler or printer a few feet further from your seat allowing you to get up and move to retrieve what you need is a great start.<strong>1</strong> How about walking down the hall to talk to a coworker opposed to writing an email? Maybe even walking down the street to get those new business cards instead of having Fed-ex deliver them in two business days.\n\nAs Ron Burgundy would say, “Tuesday is arms and back”. You may decide to do thousands of shirtless bicep curls in your fishbowl of an office, or be more practical and fully-clothed perform 50 push-ups before and after each phone call—all the small efforts add up. Purchasing some dumbbells or resistance bands for the office are a great way to keep toned and active during the day. Taking advantage of lunch breaks is another great way to increase daily activity, even just walking 15 minutes before your mid-day meal provides tons of benefits.\n\nYou have an unlimited list of activities you can perform when stuck in the office for hours on end. You may be embarrassed to go for a run during lunch, or occupy the hall with your endless minutes of wall sits, but I can assure you that your work life and personal life will happily condone these activities. Start now, and change what many cannot.\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>Featured Image Credit: easygethealth.com</h4>\n\n<hr />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Jamming to the beats of your favorite 90’s boy band, or the screams of your ultimate metal playlist may push you through that last 20 minutes of your daily WOD. Once you have the music, its time get your own stopwatch. Maybe it hangs from your neck and reminds you of your junior high track coach. Perhaps your stopwatch has an integrated heart rate monitor, GPS, calorie tracker, and instant espresso maker—either way that stopwatch will allow you to time your workouts. Once you notice change in your times of each daily workout, its time to get the big bland whiteboard with some expo markers to start keeping track of the goals your demolishing. But if you don’t enjoy carrying a 4x4 foot whiteboard, a journal and pen should do the job great.\n\nApplying the benefits of all this equipment with a high quality nutritional plan will help you dominate those personal goals. Whether those goals may be to find the hidden six pack you haven’t seen since grade school, or train to become the new face of the crossfit games—this foundation will get you there.\n\n<hr />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReferences\n\n1.Lance Fischer (October 01, 2014) 25 Items a Crossfit Garage Gym Can't Live Without.

Egg White protein has often been over looked when compared to Whey or Casein, but it actually has many benefits as a supplement and it is something that ought be considered to include in your diet for the best possible gains.\n\nEgg white powder is dehydrated (dried) egg whites. AMRAP Bars use egg white protein powder in their Paleo Refuel bars because of the numerous health benefits that it provides. At AMRAP, we only use egg white powder from growth hormone-free chickens. Egg protein has the highest biological value because of its combination of essential amino acids and sulfur containing proteins, all of which can be used by the body for natural, healthy muscle maintenance. In addition, egg whites are high in protein and contain no cholesterol or fats. This helps you reach your optimal protein absorption without worrying about taking in unwanted components.<sup>1</sup>\n\n<strong>Advantages of Egg Whites (Dehydrated Powder)</strong>\n\nThere are hundreds of protein powders on the market; it’s a very large product category with many options to choose from.

It also is:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Loaded with essential amino acids you need for muscle maintenance, recovery, and growth.</li>\n\t<li>Optimal digestive speed to help build muscle and prevent muscle breakdown</li>\n\t<li>Provides nourishment, blocks digestive enzymes, and contains important vitamins, minerals, and carbohydrates</li>\n\t<li>Egg White is a complete protein- it provides your body with amino acids that your body doesn’t naturally produce on its own</li>\n\t<li>High protein content without the cholesterol and fat found in yolks</li>\n\t<li>Rich in Riboflavin which the body needs for cell growth</li>\n\t<li>Lactose free for those with a dairy allergy</li>\n\t<li>Cholesterol and/or fat free</li>\n\t<li>No artificial sweeteners, preservatives, flavors, or colors</li>\n</ul>\nThere are also many other important benefits- such as digestion speed, amino acid content, and no extra fat. Whey is fast digesting to build muscles, casein (milk) is slow digesting to help prevent muscle breakdown, and moderate digesting egg white protein does <strong><em>both</em></strong> by continually supplying your muscles with amino acids to help build muscle and prevent muscle breakdown, which is what you want.\n\nIt is also key when picking a protein supplement to be aware of the amino acid content. We all know that amino acids are the building blocks are protein. Your body makes 10 amino acids, but there are also 10 other essential amino acids that must be obtained through food. A food that contains all 10 of these is known as a complete protein, and guess what? Egg white powder is a complete protein. Other proteins, such as plant-based proteins like rice or pea, are incomplete.\n\nYou might be thinking, why not just eat eggs? While whole eggs are a good source of protein, they also come with the added fat and calories. One large egg contains around 5 grams of fat. It would take 4 whole eggs to get the same amount of protein as you would with the egg white protein powder, which unfortunately adds the extra 20 grams of added fat.<sup>3</sup>\n\nEgg white protein is an ideal protein source for your active and exciting lifestyle. It is important to know what you are putting into your body and also, where it came from. It is clean protein that you can feel great about using it. Reap all of the benefits that it provides!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences:\n\n1. (2014). <em>All Natural Egg White Protein</em>.

You might go for what is most convenient; perhaps an energy drink, candy bars, or chips in the snack machine at the office. The problem with those is that they actually do way more harm than good.

Eat nutrient-dense foods, introduce variety to your exercises, and manage your stress levels.","Content":"Life isn’t a sprint. It’s a marathon. Filled with a lifetime of challenges, successes and failures. You need the strength to iendure, every minute, every year, every decade. Tennyson believed we’re all “one equal temper of heroic hearts, made weak by time and fate.” But for us endurance athletes out there, I think we can make our hearts just a little stronger by the energy we spend improving our lives. Fuel your health, your heroic heart.\n\nEvery day, our hearts beat 100,000 times sending 2,000 gallons of blood through our bodies. Although it’s no bigger than our fist–just 11 ounces–our heart has the constant task of keeping blood flowing through 60,000 miles of arteries, veins, and capillaries that feed our body’s vital tissues and organs. The human heart does the most physical work of any muscle during our lifetimes–twice as hard as the leg muscles of a sprinter–and beats up to 2.5 billion times.\n\nAny damage to our heart or its valves can reduce it’s pumping power, forcing it to work harder just to keep up with our body’s insane demand for blood. So first thing’s first. We need a fresh new start for a healthier heart.<a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/heart/features/amazing-facts-about-heart-health-and-heart-disease\"><sup>1</sup></a>\n\nA fresh start begins in our bellies. Oprah Winfrey tells us “we eat what’s in our fridge.” That makes sense, right? So we need our diet to be a little more conducive to improving our cardiovascular endurance. We need whole, organic foods that are rich in vitamins, nutrients, and minerals that will protect our precious little pumpers. Try some of these heart-boosting foods:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Coconuts, and avocados</li>\n\t<li>Egg whites</li>\n\t<li>Olive, krill, and coconut oil</li>\n\t<li>Raw nuts and seeds</li>\n\t<li>Organic, grass-fed meats</li>\n\t<li>Wild Salmon</li>\n\t<li>Whole Apples</li>\n\t<li>Fresh, natural water</li>\n</ul>\nFresh new fridge, <em>check</em>. Now let’s do some field tests. The best exercises for improving cardiovascular endurance are activities that elevate your heart rate, keeping it elevated for sustained periods of time. By exercising in order to elevate your heart rate, you strengthen your heart. You improve your natural blood flow. You burn that fat. You improve your ability to deliver oxygen to your muscles. All of these are the <em>hallmarks of cardiovascular endurance</em>.<a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/105668-exercises-improve-cardiovascular-endurance\"><sup>2</sup></a> Try a few of these heart-boosting exercises:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Fast-paced walking,</li>\n\t<li>Swimming</li>\n\t<li>Running</li>\n\t<li>Cycling</li>\n\t<li>Cross-country skiing</li>\n\t<li>In-line skating</li>\n\t<li>Jumping Rope</li>\n</ul>\nFresh new exercises, <em>check</em>. Maintaining and improving this endurance is a lot of work. Remember, life isn’t a sprint–it’s a marathon. Healthy diet and exercise–we’re in it for the long haul. Every creature on earth has approximately two billion heartbeats to spend in a lifetime.<a href=\"http://theamericanscholar.org/joyas-volardores/#.VBMyREuRPwI\"><sup>3</sup></a> So make them count. Eat nutrient-dense Paleo foods, introduce a strong variety to your exercises, and manage your stress levels. If you can tackle the first two, they’ll directly impact the third. Remember, we are powerful beyond measure. “That which we are, we are; one equal temper of heroic hearts, made weak by time and fate, but strong in will, to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.”<a href=\"http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/skyfall/\"><sup>4</sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured image by: <a href=\"http://gbtimes.com/life/64-year-old-makes-first-successful-cuba-florida-swim\" target=\"_blank\">GBTimes</a></h4>\n\n<hr />\n\nREFERENCES\n<ol>\n\t<li>Watson,Stephanie; Chang, Louis, M.D. (2014). <em>Amazing Facts About Heart Health and Heart Disease.</em> Retreived from: <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/heart/features/amazing-facts-about-heart-health-and-heart-disease_\">http://www.webmd.com/heart/features/amazing -facts- about-heart-health-and-heart- disease</a></li>\n\t<li>Sloan, Jim (2013, Dec 8). <em>Exercise to Improve Cardiovascular Endurance.</em> Retrieved from <a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/105668-exercises-improve-cardiovascular-endurance/\">http://www.livestrong.com/article/105668-exercises-improve-cardiovascular- endurance/</a></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li>Doyle, Brian (2004). <em>Joyas Volardores. </em>Retreived from: <a href=\"http://theamericanscholar.org/joyas-volardores/#.VBMyREuRPwI\">http://theamericanscholar.org/ joyas-volardores/#.VBMyREuRPwI</a></li>\n\t<li>Lord Tennyson, Alfred.

Use these Paleo breakfast ideas often.","Content":"Breakfast is a big deal. Depending on your fitness performance goals, giving your body some proper nutrition first thing in the morning will give you the jumpstart you need to power through your day. Paleo breakfasts are packed with clean protein and healthy fats, not to mention they’re absolutely delicious. Make breakfast something to look forward to with these easy, simple, and fun Paleo foods!\n\nEggs and Meats-We love eggs because they are simple and can be prepared so many different ways. Eggs are highly nutritious and loaded with protein for the perfect start to your day. Fried eggs, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs - or throw in some chicken and bacon (for added protein and bulking), with some avocados and tomatoes to make a delicious omelet. If you’re on the run, they’re are quick and will give you just what you need.\n\nGreen Vegetables-Who wants veggies for breakfast? WE DO! That might seem like an odd idea, but mix some spinach or kale in your favorite smoothie with some water, fresh fruits, and juice and it is a perfect way to get those healthy greens into your daily diet.\n\nRipe Fruits-They contain many essential nutrients and are loaded with vitamins and antioxidants. Vitamin-C helps grow and repair your body tissues and potassium maintains healthy blood pressure while the antioxidants work to remove free radicals from the body. Most fruits are naturally low in fat, calories, sodium, and free from cholesterol. From berries and bananas to apples and oranges, fruits are a wonderful go-to food for the mornings.\n\nGive your body some Paleo nutrition to start your day off right.

Here are tips.","Content":"Dietary supplements are a mixed bag, especially the pre-workout supplement space. If you are like me, you are distrustful of white powdery supplements making grand promises. It’s not food. How will your body break it down without sacrificing your long term health?\n\nWhile it is true that we should get the majority of nutrients from our diet, pairing that along with high quality supplements can take you from the “new years resolution” gym goer to the athlete of the year. Fortunately there are places to find natural organic Nitric oxide supplements that offer performance at no cost to your more vital organs. Your heart will actually be happy.\n\nNitric oxide is one supplement you want to pay attention to.\n\nNitric oxide aid isn’t just beneficial to athletes and fitness gurus, but for the average American just trying to increase their overall health. Nitric oxide production within the body on a daily basis helps with cardiovascular health. So how can you boost the level of nitric oxide your body produces?\n\nFirst understand, nitric oxide is naturally produced in the human body. When foods with high nitrate content are consumed, the body will convert nitrates into nitric oxide. From there, nitric oxide delivers a host of benefits, including:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Lowers blood pressure</li>\n\t<li>Boosts stamina</li>\n\t<li>Increases blood flow to the brain</li>\n\t<li>Reduces cancer risk</li>\n</ul>\nBy increasing blood flow, the body is then aided in the prevention of high blood pressure. And if you don’t know, nearly 31% of Americans have high blood pressure [1]. High blood pressure can result in heart attacks and stroke, so it would only make sense to decrease the likelihood of these health concerns by increasing your nitrate consumption.\n\nOne common topic of athletes in this newly transformed industry is a pre-workout booster. The reason for pre-workout supplements is to help give your body and mind that motivational edge when stepping in the gym or starting your training session. The primary help of ntiric oxide supplements is to assist your body in creating more nitric oxide in the blood to help dilate the veins and arteries to increase blood flow, which boosts the process of nutrient transportation as well as the transportation of oxygen to your working muscle fibers.\n\nMany of these pre-workout formulas contain essential amino acids such as L-arginine or L-Citruline to aid in the formation of NO within the body. [2] By encouraging higher production of nitric oxide, exercise becomes less exhaustive and athletes are able to endure exercises for extended time periods.\n\nSome more natural sources that contain these nitric oxide compounds include:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Beetroot (Beets)</li>\n\t<li>Carrots</li>\n\t<li>Leafy greens such as spinach and kale</li>\n\t<li>Grass-fed meats</li>\n\t<li>Strawberries</li>\n</ul>\nVegetables contain the highest healthy form of nitrates per gram but you may also get nitric oxide benefits from L-arginine and L-citruline in concentrated formulas. While these two amino acids have positive effects on the body, many are present in processed, stimulant filled pre-workouts. In order to get the best possible results, the natural choice is the best choice.\n\nIf buying pounds of fresh vegetables to fuel your body before a daily workout is not within your budget plan, you can find much more simplistic and healthy pre-workout options to increase your nitric oxide production.\n\nIn the past, highly processed sugary drinks, chews, etc. have corned the pre-workout supplement. Controversial opinions swirl over the nutritional value of processed pre-workout supplements; this is causing many people to consider alternative nutrient-dense food supplements to deliver enhanced sports performance. Organic concentrated beetroot juice is emerging as an effective food-based pre-workout alternative.\n\nWhen you decide to take a stand and start researching for yourself, you can truly decide on what’s best for you and your own body. What works for one person might not work for you, so let this be the start where you can gather your own knowledge and conduct a plan of execution for a healthy and happy life.\n<h4>Featured Image by: <a href=\"http://crossfitrefinery.com\" target=\"_blank\">CrossFit Refinery</a></h4>\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>References</strong>\n<ol>\n\t<li>CDC- High blood pressure facts. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm\">http://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm</a></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n\t<li>Pronutritionist- Nitrates are beneficial. <a href=\"http://www.pronutritionist.net/nitrates-are-beneficial-where-did-i-get-it-wrong/\">http://www.pronutritionist.net/nitrates-are-beneficial-where-did-i-get-it-wrong/</a></li>\n</ol>","Slug":"best-nitric-oxide-pre-workout-supplement","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/best-nitric-oxide-pre-workout-supplement/","Path":"/interesting_other/best-nitric-oxide-pre-workout-supplement/","Date":"2014-10-16","Year":"2014","Month":"10","Day":"16","Categories":"Interesting Other | Nutrition Hacks","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Nitric-oxide-preworkout.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Nitric-oxide-preworkout.jpg","Image Alt Text":"Nitric Oxide Pre Workout Supplement"},{"id":"1422","Title":"Caveman Fuel: Paleo Snacks On the Go","Meta Description":"Sweet, savory, and convenient Paleo snacks on the go. 3 snacks you can prep at home or buy from a preferred Paleo store depending on your need.","Content":"“Life moves pretty fast, if we don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.”<sup>1</sup> But hey, we’re also athletes, parents, students, managers, friends…the list goes on.

Nutrition for crossFit endurance demands adequate food and hydration.","Content":"The human body is incredible. We were built to succeed. We climb mountains, swim ocean channels, run across deserts, and cycle across countries. Faster. Stronger. Further. We train for the insane ability to endure more pain. We do it for fun, the sporting aspect, for that mad war against gravity and inertia. Physical dominance is our greatest natural conquest–it separates us, man from beast–survival of the fittest.\n\nPopularity in endurance challenges continues to rise. The long runs, the grueling WODS, the endless cycling. These sports test our souls. Every year, more and more people are testing the very limits of their mitochondrial intake on endurance sports. Most high-intensity endurance challenges are designed to last anywhere from 30 minutes to 17 hours. That’s taxing. Endurance nutrition at this level requires refueling of the most spectacular kind, high carbohydrate consumption and adequate hydration. Optimize your nutrition for CrossFit endurance to see higher performance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>THE FUELS</strong>\n\nCarbohydrates, lean proteins, and healthy fats–all you need to provide your body with the right fuel. It’s the right stuff. Endurance athletes should aim for 45-65% of daily calories from carbohydrates, 15-20 % from proteins and 20-35 %percent from fats.\n\nCarbohydrates provide the perfect fuel for most endurance activities. They’re easily digested, quickly used. Adequate carbs prevent fatigue and injury. They save your battery life, keep you drumming. Carbohydrates are a primary fuel for exercise and sports, especially moderate to high intensities.\n\nHealthy fats are vital source of energy for lengthy, lower to moderate intensities. You’re body needs to store it–it’s like endurance insurance for those long, grueling days on the grind. Endurance terrain is unforgiving.\n\nProtein is pretty important. Okay, it’s really important, especially to the high-intensity CrossFit athlete. It helps build and repair muscles, aids in fluid balance and promotes immune function–you fight the good fight. Protein is also used fuel for endurance exercise and sport. Endurance athletes need more protein than regular folks. They’re just not on our level.<a href=\"http://www.active.com/nutrition/articles/top-10-superfoods-for-endurance-athletes\"><sup>1</sup></a>\n\nWalnuts are a plant-based protein, rich in fiber, rich in vitamins and antioxidants. They contain the most Omega-3 fatty acids than any other nut and the anti-inflammatory nutrients are great for bone health. Make a great energizing and healthy snack.\n\nCherries are one of the most antioxidant-rich fruit and provide high performance and recovery benefits. The post-exercise benefits are astonishing because of the fruit's natural anti-inflammatory components. You’ll fight soreness more efficiently. Bananas are your best before and after snacks. Loaded with Potassium and Vitamin B6, bananas help restock your body with lost electrolytes after any sort of physical exertion. Vitamin B6 is a natural anti-inflammatory.\n\nKale contains vitamins, calcium, and iron and it’s an antioxidant-rich vegetable that helps regulate the body's inflammatory process. It’s a darn good veggie.\n\nSalmon is one of the most nutrient dense proteins on the planet. Salmon can help reduce inflammation in our bodies through it's high content of Omega-3's. The antioxidants in salmon are beneficial for cardiovascular protection. Simply put, it protects your heart.<sup>1</sup> Your heart’s got about two billion beats in your lifetime, so keep it healthy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>THE FLUIDS</strong>\n\nDehydration prior to your endurance trek is all too common. It’ll ruin your whole day. Whether you’re on a training run or race day, drinking adequate fluids before <em>go-time</em> is a game changer. If you don’t, you’ll burn out. You’ll fry the machine. You’ll melt the engine. You’re body needs to be ready. Four hours ready to be precise. Athletes need to be drinking 20-30 ounces prior to the beginning of their race.\n\nRemaining hydrated throughout your exercise is just as important too. You have to maintain your thermoregulation–you’ve got to keep that system cool. You also need to minimize your body mass loss through sweating. Limit weight loss more than 2-3% during exercises that last more than 90 minutes.<a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/.VBxU8kuRPwI\"><sup>2</sup></a>\n\nWhat have we learned? Maximizing our endurance is crucial. Proper nutrition for crossfit endurance is essential for success. Fuel depletion and fluid dehydration are the greatest obstacles we’ll face as endurance athletes. Carbohydrates, healthy fats, lean protein, and good old’ fashioned will keep your body in check. You’ve got to be the tortoise. You’ve got to stay for the long haul…for as many rounds as possible. #AMRAP\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured Image By: <a href=\"http://crossfitredbank.com\" target=\"_blank\">CrossFit Redbank</a></h4>\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences\n<ol>\n\t<li>Barger, Alana.

There are at least eight major benefits in beetroot.","Content":"Roman gladiators fought like gods. Their ideology was simple–to live like champions, to succeed, to endure, and to conquer: <em>Deos fortioribus adesse–The gods are on the side of the stronger</em>.<a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tentonhammer.com%2Fnode%2F12643&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHOoC35wmuUl3RGkb3PW6FGLcAk-Q\"><sup>1</sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe genesis of Roman strength came from within–literally. They trained the hardest. They fought the longest. They never quit (well, mostly). Also, they ate the best stuff on Earth. The insatiable appetites of Rome’s mightiest soldiers included a healthy dose of beetroot. The health benefits of beetroot are astounding.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI’m not a gladiator. But I train like one, and I damn sure eat like one. When I walk into my Crossfit gym, I’m ready to do battle–like a warrior poet, <em>Once more into the fray… Into the last good fight I’ll ever know.

Ancient Romans used beetroot as a treatment for fevers and thought the leaves were good for binding wounds.<a href=\"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/ingredient-focus-beetroot\"><sup>3</sup></a> A smart choice after running a high temperature from taking a Scottish spear to the abdomen.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRomans typically ate them raw, and people have been doing the same for thousands of years–its Paleo. Beetroot tastes so yummy because of its high sugar content–it also has holds nutritional value worthy of a Centurion.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>            <em>Calcium</em></strong>: Great for building strong bones and teeth.

Thats right, that simple sugar packet you add to your morning coffee is killing you and the sugar found on frosted flakes is poisoning your children.\n\nSo you might be wondering \"how do I go about breaking my sugar addiction\". Lucky for you <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Psychology Today</a> has a great five step article on <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/prescriptions-life/201403/how-break-your-sugar-addiction\" target=\"_blank\">breaking sugar addictions</a> (summarized below):\n<ol>\n\t<li>Find different rewards, instead of a cupcake; get a massage.</li>\n\t<li>Don't switch to a new bad habits (ie. give up sugar for potato chips).</li>\n\t<li>If you need a sweet treat, find something made with raw honey.</li>\n\t<li>Don't test it, one little donut could send you back to rehab</li>\n\t<li>Finally, it's not welcome; don't have any sugar in the house!</li>\n</ol>\nWe need to join together and inform our friends and family of the dangers and addicting qualities of processed sugar (white sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar).

Simply put just go on a 24-hour fast, eat a big dinner wake up to a crazy busy day and just drink a lot of coffee and water (for some reason we've noticed that coffee reduces food cravings as does a mid day workout and if you're busy you wont notice how hungry you are).

Let’s ease up. Yes, some recent research calls into question the absolute certainty of the famous statement “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.” But it’s a problem when people take <a href=\"http://www.outsideonline.com/fitness/bodywork/performance-plate/Breakfast-Schmeakfast.html\">mild questioning</a> and turn it into a wholehearted indictment of something, such as the early-morning meal that many athletes need for optimal performance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAthletes, mind you. Beasts. If we’re talking about everyday people who care more about run-of-the-mill weight loss than anything else, it might be a different story. But finely tuned athletes need the right <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/\">Paleo fuel</a> for their machine-like efforts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOf course, every <a href=\"http://www.crossfit.com/\">CrossFit</a> athlete is different.

There are several key factors to consider, including:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Do you usually wake up hungry?</li>\n\t<li>What time of day do you normally work out?</li>\n\t<li>Do you perform better with a recently fueled body?</li>\n\t<li>Do you participate in <a href=\"http://www.precisionnutrition.com/intermittent-fasting\">intermittent fasting</a>?</li>\n\t<li>Does your body respond better to several small meals or a couple large meals on a daily basis?</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nAgain, it’s about your body, not about a glut of Internet chatter. Do you think our ancestors sat around worrying about what time of day to eat? They ate when their bodies screamed out “Feed me!”\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet’s not get hung up on recipes, either. If breakfast is important to you, then anything from <a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/86412886571191655/\">inventive pancakes</a> to <a href=\"http://crossfitfenrir.com/quick-paleo-breakfast-options/\">protein-packed bites</a> can get the job done.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShould athletes eat breakfast?

But it’s better to be prepared than angry.\n\nSome people are just haters who have no interest in reasonable discourse about the paleo lifestyle. Others are jealous of CrossFit athletes and want to rag on anything associated with it. But <em>most </em>actually have valid questions and concerns about paleo.\n\nHere are a few tips for explaining paleo to someone who doesn’t understand:\n\n<strong>Start with the basics</strong>\n\nNo one enjoys being bragged to or talked down to, so don’t submit your potential paleo converts to this type of junk. Don’t dwell on high-level details until the listener begins to comprehend the basics.\n\nIn other words, start with the importance of our ancestors, not with keto gains.\n\n<strong>Be brief</strong>\n\nWe’re living in a world dominated by Twitter, Instagram and vines, and people want info as quickly as possible. So, leave the long-winded rants at home. Instead work on a well-thought, <a href=\"http://paleoleap.com/paleo-elevator-speech/\">concise summary</a> of why primal eating makes sense.\n\n<strong>Pass the eye test</strong>\n\nLook around. More importantly, look at people’s phones. If you don’t have images, you won’t anyone’s attention.\n\nWhen you have a chance to talk about paleo, consider using colorful, easy-to-understand <a href=\"http://greatist.com/health/ultimate-guide-eating-paleo-infographic\">infographics as a guide.</a>\n\n<strong>Know the misconceptions</strong>\n\nYour opinions about the paleo way likely will be met with questions — some valid, some ridiculous. Many of these misguided ideas are based on erroneous facts, such as:\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong><em>Paleo eaters are snobs. —</em></strong> The people who embrace this lifestyle are concerned with the health of them and their families. If caring about the well-being of loved ones is wrong, so be it.</li>\n\t<li><strong><em>Paleo eaters eat nothing but meat. —</em></strong> Some of the most beloved paleo recipe ingredients are outside the meat family, including avocadoes, sweet potatoes, and tons of fresh fruits and vegetables.</li>\n\t<li><strong><em>Paleo is a weight-</em></strong>loss fad. <strong><em>—</em></strong> Eating the way cavemen did is much more about overall, preventive health than weight loss. That said, many people will see big differences in their bodies once they radically improve their diet.</li>\n</ol>\nPerhaps more than anything, remember to be patient. Answer the questions, ignore the haters and offer honest information whenever appropriate.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured Image By: <a href=\"http://www.hermamas.com/2013/10/guest-post-by-jesse-emeric-explaining.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hermamas.com</a></h4>","Slug":"4-infallible-tips-explaining-paleo-concerns","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/nutrition_hacks/4-infallible-tips-explaining-paleo-concerns/","Path":"/nutrition_hacks/4-infallible-tips-explaining-paleo-concerns/","Date":"2014-11-10","Year":"2014","Month":"11","Day":"10","Categories":"Lifestyle Design | Nutrition Hacks","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/explainingpaleodiet.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/explainingpaleodiet.jpg","Image Alt Text":"explain_paleo_diet"},{"id":"1491","Title":"Paleo Apps That Make Life Easier","Meta Description":"There are many mobile apps that can make your paleo lifestyle easier.

","Meta Description":"cardiovascular endurance explained","Content":"<h2>Feel Good About Your Genetic Athletic Potential</h2>\nI’ve always wanted to be in the kind of shape where I could wake up and run a marathon if I felt like it. Well, last weekend I did it. I ran 26.2 miles with basically no distance training. I just ate ‘paleoranically’ and did crossfit. My longest run logged was no more than six miles.\n\nEverytime I run a marathon, I’m amazed that I’m able to accomplish such a feat. I feel like I can never <i>really</i> train for 26.2 anyway. I just listen to the experts and emulate their training regimens. Besides, on race day all bets are off. It’s an any given Sunday sort-a thing. However, as a human being, I’ve learned that this kind of performance-ability is uniquely plausible for all of us. Cardiovascular endurance explained human propensity for athletic success.\n\nCardiovascular endurance refers to the your fantastic human ability to sustain prolonged exercise for minutes, hours, and even days. The energy system in long distance exercises is <i>glycolysis in the cytoplasm of cells</i>, a cool science term for <i>aerobic metabolism</i>, which supplies most of the energy needed for less intense, long duration exercise that requires oodles of oxygen.<a href=\"http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/anatomyandphysiology/a/Endurance.htm\">1</a>\n\nAs natural distance runners, our long-striding legs are teemed with muscles, tendons, and ligaments that are super-springy and allow us to store elastic energy in our legs and feet as we come down, recoil, then propel forward. These are impressive mechanisms perfected by the millennia of genetic mutation and survival-of-the-fittest fine tuning. The most valuable of springer muscles, the achilles tendons, aren’t even found in early humans–Australopithecus–those old school ape-like humans. Our high-end tendons evolved for distance running in the African savannah more than 2 million years ago turning us into the elite distance runners that we are now.\n\nWe also have evolved large leg and foot joints which spread out high forces that must be absorbed when running. We have big gluteus maximus muscles that support two-legged stability. Our torsos counter-rotate against our hips when we run, also aiding stability. Additionally, we have a large percentage of fatigue-resistant, slow-twitch muscle fibers–equipped for endurance.\n\nMost animals are designed for sprinting because they’re either fast moving predators or prey, and their muscles have more fast-twitch fibers. For example, Cheetahs have hind-leg muscles that are the extremely fast-twitching. Think Usain Bolt like muscles–which are merely 38% of cheetah potential.<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2012/06/long_distance_running_and_evolution_why_humans_can_outrun_horses_but_can_t_jump_higher_than_cats_.html\">2</a>\n\nHuman endurance is biomechanically built into our genetic coding. After millions of years of evolution, we’re now designed to be exceptionally efficient in high-level running endurance. Allowing us to wake up, run a marathon, rest, and repeat. (Not professionally recommended). We not the fastest creatures capable of cheetah-speed, but we’ve been engineered to be far superior than them in cardiovascular endurance.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured Image: www.atrailrunnersblog.com</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Many of you may be thinking how much you love being gluten free and how your health is not at risk anymore since switching over, however, the truth is, you might be unaware of the real reasons why a person needs a gluten-free diet, or what celiac disease is.\n\nYou may be telling yourself “I have celiac disease”, but unless you are the 1 in 100 individuals who happen to have it, you probably don’t. This autoimmune disease can have severe impacts on your health down the line, but if you are diagnosed in your early years, you can save yourself some health problems by switching over to the gluten free diet.<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/gluten-free-diet/art-20048530\">1</a>\n\nNonetheless, whether you have celiac disease or not, you can still benefit from taking on a form of the gluten free diet. This regime allows you to avoid mass amounts of starchy carbohydrates and processed foods that you probably don’t need to consume in the first place. Gluten is a protein that is found in a few types of grains such as wheat, rye, barley, and triticale (a cross between rye and wheat). So avoiding these types of grains really isn’t that complicated when looking at the big picture. It can be tricky though, many individuals often aren’t aware of the products that may be mixed with gluten containing grains, additives, or preservatives. <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/gluten-free-diet/art-20048530\">1</a>\n\nThe majority of food consumed in America’s diet contains some sort of these gluten filled grains. So when it comes to going gluten free, it is a big change and proves to be a hard task to try and stay away from grains. Though most of your previous meals consumed bread, cereals, and grains; there is a large selection of other types of grains and starches to choose from, these include:<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/gluten-free-diet/art-20048530\">1</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Amaranth</li>\n\t<li>Arrowroot</li>\n\t<li>Buckwheat</li>\n\t<li>Corn and cornmeal</li>\n\t<li>Flax</li>\n\t<li>Gluten-free flours (rice, soy, corn, potato, bean)</li>\n\t<li>Hominy (corn)</li>\n\t<li>Millet</li>\n\t<li>Quinoa</li>\n\t<li>Rice</li>\n\t<li>Sorghum</li>\n\t<li>Soy</li>\n\t<li>Teff</li>\n</ul>\nIf your goal is to be gluten free and completely stay away from starchy carbs and grains and you find it to be difficult, then there may be a better alternative for you. This alternative has been around for thousands of years and has recently been reintroduced to our society. The Paleolithic diet, or “Paleo diet” focuses on the caveman foundations of health and recalls the days of our hunter gatherer ancestors. The diet is simple and straightforward, this “Eat” or “Don’t Eat” structure can give you the general idea of how to eat and prepare meals. <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/gluten-free-diet/art-20048530\">2</a>\n\n<strong>EAT:</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Grass-produced meats</li>\n\t<li>Fish/seafood</li>\n\t<li>Fresh fruits and veggies</li>\n\t<li>Eggs</li>\n\t<li>Nuts and seeds</li>\n\t<li>Healthful oils (Olive, walnut, flaxseed, macadamia, avocado, coconut)</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>DON’T EAT:</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Cereal grains</li>\n\t<li>Legumes (including peanuts)</li>\n\t<li>Dairy</li>\n\t<li>Refined sugar</li>\n\t<li>Potatoes</li>\n\t<li>Processed foods</li>\n\t<li>Salt</li>\n\t<li>Refined vegetable oils</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nWhether you decide to regularly consume your meals full of grains and starches or limit them to a few times a week, following some of these guidelines will improve your overall health and help you achieve your goals.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured image: Box Life Magazine</h4>\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences\n<ol>\n\t<li>Mayo Clinic Staff (2011, Dec 20) Nutrition and healthy eating: Gluten-free diet: What’s allowed, What’s Not.

High levels of Omega-3 Fatty Acids in fish oil deliver vital nutrients to regulate and support cellular health.","Content":"<strong>HUMAN MACHINE:</strong> The human body is mechanized brilliance. An organic machine made up of more than 37 trillion moving parts–our cells. Every one more unique than the last. Each one tells a story about who we are, what we look like, and what we can do. Everyday, millions of our cells replicate, live, die, and repeat. It’s a never-ending cycle, a microscopic marathon in the parts-per-million. Pretty impressive machinery if you think about it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>FISH FOR THOUGHT:</strong> One of the healthiest foods for our human machines is fish. It’s because of their high levels of Omega-3 Fatty Acids (O3s) found in fish oil. They’re essentially the building blocks of healthy fats, which are vital nutrients our bodies use to regulate and support cellular health. They improve protein synthesis, and boost the nutrient delivery in/out of our cells. They literally improve the makeup of our cellular structure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>FISH OIL:</strong> It is best found in wild fish and is especially abundant in Salmon, Trout, Halibut, Sardines, Swordfish, Oysters, Tuna, Mackerel, and Herring.<a href=\"http://tomnikkola.com/9-serious-health-benefits-of-fish-oil/\"><sup>1</sup></a> The American Heart Association even recommends that we take 1,000 mg of O3s every single day. They’re pretty much a big deal.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>BRAIN HEALTH</strong>: More than half of the fats in our brains and parts of our nerve cells are made up of Omega-3 DHA–a primary component of our brains and cerebral cortexes. So, brain performance and cognitive function are strongly influenced by the amount of O3s in our diet–they enhance memory, support thinking speed, and increase our overall cognitive abilities.<a href=\"http://www.omegavia.com/fish-oil-benefits/\"><sup>2</sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>HEART BENEFITS:</strong> O3s in fish oil are also effective in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. And, can reduce the risk of common heart diseases. It also lowers our levels of bad cholesterol, and increases our levels of good cholesterol. Fish oil also prevents the accumulation of triglycerides–a type of fat found in blood that increases the <em>risk</em> of heart disease.<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/triglycerides/art-20048186\"><sup>3</sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>STRONGER IMMUNITY:</strong> It is believed that regular consumption of fish oil aids in boosting our immune systems. Thus, enabling us to resist the occurrence of common illnesses such as colds, coughs, and the even the flu. Basically, fish oil has the potential to enhance the immune system of humans and help reduce associated fevers, and fatigue.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>ANTI-INFLAMMATION:</strong> Fish oil is effective in reducing inflammation in our blood and tissues. Regular consumption of fish oil can be beneficial to our joints–their powerful anti-inflammatory properties reduce joint discomfort, and morning stiffness. They even reduces enzymes that destroy our precious cartilage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>BONE STRENGTH:</strong> Fish oil is also essential for optimal bone health–a vital constituent of healthy modeling bone and maintaining bone mineral density. Adding in a regular strength training routine in addition to fish oil consumption has been known to help prevent diseases like osteoporosis.<a href=\"http://www.chatelaine.com/health/wellness/the-benefits-of-fish-oil-seven-surprising-ways-it-improves-your-health/\"><sup>4</sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>SKIN CARE:</strong> Fish oil is also great for improving the condition of irritable, dry skin–making it shiny and vibrant. Regular consumption of fish oil even helps in reducing moisture loss from our skin.This benefits thermoregulation <a href=\"https://www.organicfacts.net/organic-animal-products/organic-fish/health-benefits-of-fish-oil.html\"><sup>5</sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>GONE FISHING:</strong> Our bodies are like super-celled sponges–they soak up <em>everything</em> we give them. It’s vital that we fuel them with the best stuff on earth. From the freshest lakes to the deepest oceans, fish and their Omega-3-loaded fish oil can boost our active lifestyles up to the highest notch–giving us some big-time health benefits. The choice is ours–we can sink or swim.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFeatured Image By: Joel Sartore\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences\n<ol>\n\t<li>Nikkola, Tom (2013, July 20). <em>9 Serious Health Benefits Of Fish Oil. </em>Retreived from: <a href=\"http://tomnikkola.com/9-serious-health-benefits-of-fish-oil/\">http://tomnikkola.com/9-serious-health-benefits-of-fish-oil/</a></li>\n\t<li>Via, Omega (2014, September). <em>Fish Oil Benefits and Your Health. </em>Retreieved from: <a href=\"http://www.omegavia.com/fish-oil-benefits/\">http://www.omegavia.com/fish-oil-benefits/</a></li>\n\t<li>Mayo Clinic Staff, (2014, September). <em>Triglycerides: Why Do They Matter? </em>Retreived from: <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/triglycerides/art-20048186\">http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/ triglycerides/art-20048186</a></li>\n\t<li>Turner, Natasha ND (2014, August 23) <a href=\"http://www.chatelaine.com/health/wellness/the-benefits-of-fish-oil-seven-surprising-ways-it-improves-your-health/\"><em>7 Health Benefits of Fish Oil: 7 Ways It Heals You. </em></a><a href=\"http://www.chatelaine.com/health/wellness/the-benefits-of-fish-oil-seven-surprising-ways-it-improves-your-health/\">Retreived from: </a><a href=\"http://www.chatelaine.com/health/wellness/the-benefits-of-fish-oil-\">http://www.chatelaine.com/health/wellness/the-benefits-of-fish-oil-</a><a href=\"http://www.chatelaine.com/health/wellness/the-benefits-of-fish-oil-seven-surprising-ways-it-improves-your-health/\"> seven-surprising-ways-it-improves-your-health/</a></li>\n\t<li>Facts, Organic (2014, September 19). <em>Health benefits of Fish Oil</em>.

It’s how strength of your heart, the single most important muscle in your body. When you're strong and your tough little ticker is max-healthy, you can add years, and even decades to your timeline. Your heart regulates oxygen flow to all of your mighty muscles. Cardiovascular health has a direct impact on your physical performance and body strength.<a href=\"http://www.mensfitness.com/training/endurance/7-ways-to-boost-your-endurance-and-stamina\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">1</span></a>\n\nCrossFit style exercises adds explosive movements to your workouts. Exercises that take tons of energy challenging your strength, stamina, and endurance simultaneously. When you become more explosive, you’ll start moving faster and build those explosive organic guns. Your endurance improves both fundamentally and exponentially.\n\nThe reason your cardio performance can be improved is because the heart is a muscle, and like all other muscles in the body if you keep working it it will adapt to the workload given.<a href=\"http://generalfitness.tripod.com/id4.html\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">2</span></a> It’s relatively easy to improve your endurance. It takes is a minimum of 15 minutes of exercise while in your target heart rate, 3 times a week. This isn’t the <i>most</i> effective way, but it’s a convenient way to get into better shape.\n\nA basic exercise program for cardiovascular training is designed for three separate training days but we’re going to do it all in one. If you haven’t joined a CrossFit gym yet, then you can test the waters before turning over to the dark side. I call this WOD the <i>Kicker-15</i>. It’ll take you about 2 hours. May the force be with you:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Treadmill (15 mins), Rowing Machine (15 mins), Push-Ups (15, 15, 15)</li>\n\t<li>Cardio Bike (15 mins), Pull-Ups (15, 15, 15), Step Machine (15 mins)</li>\n\t<li>Treadmill (15 mins), Skipping Rope (15 mins), Triceps Dips (15, 15, 15)<a href=\"http://generalfitness.tripod.com/id4.html\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">2</span></a></li>\n</ol>\nSimple stuff, repetitive, and extremely useful. “Typically the worlds best athletes are minimalists when it comes to their training.

It’s what fuels your inner cellular soul, sparks your mitochondrial output, and fires up your heart like a cornered rhino. It’s the same stuff that jumpstarts WODS: box jumps, kettle swings, rope throws, and AMRAPs. And it doesn’t need to be unhealthy long-term. Nitric Oxide benefits athletes in nearly every field.\n\nNow, just to clarify we are talking about the right thing: <strong>Nitric Oxide is not Nitrous Oxide</strong>. You would be amazed how confusing the two can be. <strong>Nitric Oxide</strong> is a very important naturally-occurring signaling molecule in the human body.

Trust me, these quick definitions will help you understand how nitric oxide works within the body and how to pull the performance benefits from it. Take a quick mental note:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>Cardiovascular System</em></strong>: Controls vascular tone. Relaxes vascular smooth muscles and reduces blood pressure. Dilates vessels and relieves the pain of angina. Inhibits the aggregation of platelets within the vessels and prevents thrombotic events.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>Nervous System</em></strong>: Acts as a neurotransmitter, including in the autonomic nervous system. Increases cerebral blood flow and oxygenation to the brain. One of the important mediators in penile erection during sexual arousal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>Lungs</em></strong>: Dilates pulmonary vessels. Beneficial in Adult Respiratory, Distress Syndrome, Pulmonary hypertension and Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease. Produced in abnormal amounts in inflammatory lung conditions. Concentration of NO in exhaled air can be taken as a marker of airway inflammation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>Gastrointestinal Tract</em></strong>: Regulates the relaxation of smooth muscles. It controls peristalsis and the function of sphincters.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>Renal System</em></strong>: Due to its vasodilator effect, increases blood flow to the kidney. Increases the glomerular filtration rate and the production of urine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>Immune System</em>:</strong> Modulates T cell-mediated immune response.<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><sup>* ** * </sup></p>\n\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">            <em>“The society that separates its scholars from its warriors will have its thinking done by </em><em>cowards and its fighting by fools.” </em>― <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/957.Thucydides\">Thucydides</a><sup>4</sup></h5>\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>What is nitric oxide and how does it work?</em> </strong>Some people think it's the gas that makes us laugh at the dentist office. Some think it's the fuel racecar drivers use to speed up their cars. But it's neither. Nitric oxide is a molecule that our body produces to help its 50 trillion cells communicate with each other by transmitting signals throughout the entire body.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>The importance of  your body's cellular activity are far-reaching</em>:</strong> NO production help memory and behavior by transmitting information between nerve cells in the brain<strong>, </strong>assist the immune system at fighting off bacteria and defending against tumors, regulate blood pressure by dilating arteries, reduce inflammation, improve sleep quality, increase your recognition of sense (i.e. smell), increase endurance and strength, assist in gastric motility</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There have been over 60,000 studies done on nitric oxide in the last 20 years and in 1998, The Nobel Prize for Medicine was given to three scientists that discovered the signaling role of nitric oxide.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We know it is good, but how do you increase NO in a healthy way?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>How to increase nitric oxide in your </em>body</strong>: The most common way to increase nitric oxide is through exercise. When you run or lift weights, your muscles need more oxygen, which is supplied by the blood. As the heart pumps with more pressure to supply the muscles with blood, the lining in your arteries releases nitric oxide into the blood, which relaxes and widens the vessel wall, allowing for more blood to pass though. As we age, our blood vessels and nitric oxide system become less efficient due to free radical damage, inactivity, and poor diet, causing our veins and arteries to deteriorate. Think of a fire hose as water rushes through it to put out a fire - it needs to expand enough to handle the pressure, still keeping enough force to put out the fire. Athletes and youth have the most optimal nitric oxide systems, reflecting their energy and resilience.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Another way to increase nitric oxide is through diet, most notably by consuming the amino acids L-arginine and L-citrulline. Arginine, which can be found in nuts, fruits, meats and dairy, directly creates nitric oxide and citrulline inside the cell (diagram 1).(6) Citrulline is then recycled back into arginine, making even more nitric oxide. Enzymes that convert arginine to citrulline, and citrulline to arginine need to function optimally for efficient nitric oxide production. We can protect those enzymes and nitric oxide by consuming healthy foods and antioxidants, like fruit, garlic, soy, vitamins C and E, Co-Q10, and alpha lipoid acid, allowing you to produce more nitric oxide. Nitric oxide only lasts a few seconds in the body, so the more antioxidant protection we provide, the more stable it will be and the longer it will last. Doctors are utilizing this science by coating stents (mesh tubes that prop open arteries after surgery) with drugs that produce nitric oxide.<sup>5</sup></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Get the full breakdown of foods that promote natural Nitric Oxide production, <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/uncategorized/fuel-performance-18-foods-nitric-oxide-production/\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><sup>* ** * </sup></p>\n\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">            <em>We must remember that one man is much the same as another, and that he is best who is trained in the severest school.” </em>–Thucydides</h5>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>Nitric oxide for athletes and bodybuilders</em></strong>: Increasing nitric oxide has become the new secret weapon for athletes and bodybuilders. Athletes are now taking supplements with L-arginine and L-citrulline to support the flow of blood and oxygen to the skeletal muscle. They also use them to facilitate the removal of exercise-induced lactic acid build-up, which reduces fatigue and recovery time. Since arginine levels become depleted during exercise, the entire arginine-nitric oxide - citrulline loop can lose efficiency, causing less-than-ideal nitric oxide levels and higher lactate levels. Supplements can help restore this loop allowing for better workouts and faster recovery from workouts.\n\nWith nitric oxide deficiencies due to aging, inactivity, smoking, high cholesterol, fatty diets, and lack of healthy foods, increasing your nitric oxide levels can help increase your energy, vitality and overall wellness. The basic adage of eating well and staying active all makes sense now.<sup>6</sup>\n\nOver 300 Spartan soldiers led the fight against the mighty Persian army–led by Xerxes, an adversary of humanity. -An impossible task. As Crossfit athletes, we’re at war with mediocrity, up in arms against the processed food. It’s a battle hard won with difficult dietary choices. Nitric Oxide production will boost your cellular performance for long-term sustainable gains.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured Image By: TrojanCrossFit.com</h4>\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences\n<ol>\n\t<li>Retrieved from: <a href=\"http://www.quoteid.com/Thucydides.html\">http://www.quoteid.com/Thucydides.html</a></li>\n\t<li>Retrieved from: <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/957.Thucydides\">http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/957.Thucydides</a></li>\n\t<li>Retrieved from: <a href=\"http://www.dermnetnz.org/pathology/nitric-oxide.html\">http://www.dermnetnz.org/pathology/nitric-oxide.html</a></li>\n\t<li>Retrieved from: <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/957.Thucydides?page=2\">http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/957.Thucydides?page=2</a></li>\n\t<li>Retrieved from: <a href=\"http://www.nutritionexpress.com/showarticle.aspx?articleid=286\">http://www.nutritionexpress.com/showarticle.aspx?articleid=286</a></li>\n\t<li>Retrieved from: <a href=\"http://www.nutritionexpress.com/showarticle.aspx?articleid=286\">http://www.nutritionexpress.com/showarticle.aspx?articleid=286</a></li>\n\t<li>Retrieved from: <a href=\"http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/t/300-script-transcript-sparta.html\">http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/t/300-script- transcript-sparta.html</a></li>\n</ol>","Slug":"stop-inefficient-training-nitric-oxide-crossfit-athletes","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/stop-inefficient-training-nitric-oxide-crossfit-athletes/","Path":"/interesting_other/stop-inefficient-training-nitric-oxide-crossfit-athletes/","Date":"2014-10-29","Year":"2014","Month":"10","Day":"29","Categories":"Everything CrossFit | Health Tips | Interesting Other | Nutrition Hacks","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/www.trojancrossfit.com_.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/www.trojancrossfit.com_.jpg","Image Alt Text":"Wall Ball Workout"},{"id":"1683","Title":"Fuel Performance: 18 Nitrate Rich Foods For Nitric Oxide Production","Content":"<h3><strong>Include Nitrate Rich Foods in Your Daily Routine for Nitric Oxide Production.</strong></h3>\n&nbsp;\n\nNitric Oxide benefits are proven (<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/uncategorized/stop-inefficient-training-nitric-oxide-crossfit-athletes/\" target=\"_blank\">check out our full spiel here</a>). While you can get access to nitric oxide supplements, its a smart idea to incorporate foods into your regular diet routine that are high in nitrates and promote continuous nitric oxide production in the body. Start with these 18 nitrate rich foods:\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5>18. <em>Dark Cocoa</em></h5>\nSeveral studies have documented that cocoa, especially the raw kind, increases nitric oxide production and lowers blood pressure. There is also evidence of cacao healing the endolethium (the thin layer of cells that lines the interior surface of blood vessels) by increasing the amount of cells that repair it. The crucial part in choosing right kind of cacao is the quality. If possible you should always buy raw unprocessed kind, because the ones they sell on markets are so over-processed that they shouldn’t be even called chocolate anymore.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><em>17. Watermelon</em></h5>\nWatermelon contains a lot of the amino acid L-Citrulline that is one of the best natural compounds to increase nitric oxide, proven by countless of studies. <a href=\"http://anabolicmen.com/boost-nitric-oxide-naturally/\">Read this post</a> to learn more about L-Citrulline and how it converts into nitric oxide in the body.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><b>16. </b><em>Pomegranate</em></h5>\nIf I would have to choose the best food for nitric oxide production and testosterone levels, it would be pomegranate. Pomegranate has been performing perfectly in every single study that it has been researched for, producing effects such as reducing arterial plaque thickness by 30% and increasing testosterone levels by 22% in peer reviewed studies.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><em>15. Walnuts</em></h5>\nWalnuts are packed with vitamin E, which helps you arteries and testosterone levels. Also it has been recently studied and proved to increase nitric oxide production and also to lower blood pressure, significantly. This is probably due to the high amounts of L-Arginine found in walnuts, which has been linked to an increase in nitric oxide production, more about L-Arginine <a href=\"http://anabolicmen.com/boost-nitric-oxide-naturally/\">here.</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><em>14. Spinach</em></h5>\nSpinach is known to have one of the highest nitrate contents of all plants, which means that it’s a pretty awesome food to eat if you are looking to increase nitric oxide production. Learn more about nitrates in foods and how those convert into nitric oxide, <a href=\"http://anabolicmen.com/boost-nitric-oxide-naturally/\">here</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><em>13. Oranges</em></h5>\nOranges and orange juice contains high amounts of vitamin C, which has been shown to protect your precious nitric oxide molecules from free radicals. So ideally there would be no point in increasing your nitric oxide levels without consuming vitamin C and antioxidants at the same time, because without the vitamin C, your beloved nitric oxide would just oxidize away before really doing anything in your body.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><strong><em>12. Beets</em></strong></h5>\nBeetroot is one of those foods that contain nitrates as explained <a href=\"http://anabolicmen.com/boost-nitric-oxide-naturally/\">here</a>. The thing that really makes beets so amazing is the fact that it is one of those foods that has highest nitrate count in all of plants, and at the same time beets are capable to lower your estrogen levels by acting as a methylate, as explained <a href=\"http://anabolicmen.com/too-much-estrogen/\">here</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><em>11. Cranberries</em></h5>\nThere are countless of health benefits that link back to cranberries. Possibly one of the less known ones is the fact that cranberries increase nitric oxide production, while lowering blood pressure significantly at the same time. This was found out by a study conducted back in the year 2000.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><em>10. Garlic</em></h5>\nResearchers say that garlic is a potent activator of NOS (nitric oxide synthase), and produces same kind of effects as Cialis or Viagra. In one study it was noted that garlic decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 8 points on subjects with high blood pressure. That’s a very impressive result from a food, as it shows to be working even better than most of the high blood pressure medications.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><em>9. Black tea</em></h5>\ncontains caffeine, which acts as a vasoconstrictor, and that’s the main reason why black tea is not something you usually see on a list of foods that increase nitric oxide. But despite black teas caffeine content, it still has some major vasodilation effects. Many studies claim that black tea significantly increases nitric oxide production and lessens the arterial stiffness. On top of that there is this study done back in 2009 which claims that more black tea = more blood flow.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><b>8. </b><em>Cayenne pepper</em></h5>\ncontains high amount of capsaicin, the compound that makes all chili’s hot. One study noted that capsaicin has a dose dependent effect, meaning that more the subjects consumed capsaicin, the more their nitric oxide levels increased and arteries relaxed.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><em>7. Honey</em></h5>\nOne animal study claims that honey significantly increases nitric oxide production. Either the high enzyme content probably causes this, or the high nitrate content that honey has.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><em>6. Pistachios</em></h5>\nLike almost all nuts, pistachios are also packed with L-Arginine, a precursor of nitric oxide that is known for its ability to increase nitric oxide production significantly.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><em>5. Salmon</em></h5>\nWild salmon is a very good source of co-enzyme Q10, enzyme that can be spotted on moisturizer adds for women. Co-enzyme Q10 is not only great for soothing wrinkles; it’s also a very good nitric oxide booster as it has been shown in dozens of studies to increase nitric oxide production significantly.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><em>4. Kale</em></h5>\nKale is also a very good source of co-enzyme Q10 that boosts nitric oxide. Kale also has very high nitrate content, which makes it very good nitric oxide booster. There are also many other health benefits linked to kale, such as increased testosterone levels and improved arterial health.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><em>3. Animal Organs</em></h5>\nOne of the greatest foods that every man should be consuming are foods like animal liver. The organs contain high amounts of cholesterol and healthy fat-soluble vitamins that boost your testosterone levels. Those organs are also very good source for co-enzyme Q10 that increases nitric oxide levels, so it’s a win-win situation if you eat organs!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><em>2. Onions</em></h5>\nOnions are not only good for your testosterone levels, as they have been shown to increase nitric oxide production in 2 different studies. They are also a very good source of vitamin C, which as explained above protects your nitric oxide molecule from free radicals. Onions also contain a compound called Quercetin, explained briefly here. Quercetin is well known for its ability to boost nitric oxide levels.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h5><em>1. Shrimp</em>:</h5>\nOne of the best sources of dietary L-Arginine, as mentioned above L-Arginine is an amino acid and precursor of nitric oxide. By consuming shrimps you are essentially increasing the amount of L-Arginine in your body which then converts into nitric oxide.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured Image By: <a href=\"http://www.uws.ac.uk/news---categories/science/uws-research-reveals-that-sunlight-combined-with-nitrate-rich-foods-improve-athletic-performance/#.VE5vxVYolKY\" target=\"_blank\">UWS - University of West Scotland</a></h4>","Slug":"fuel-performance-18-foods-nitric-oxide-production","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/fuel-performance-18-foods-nitric-oxide-production/","Path":"/interesting_other/fuel-performance-18-foods-nitric-oxide-production/","Date":"2014-10-29","Year":"2014","Month":"10","Day":"29","Categories":"Everything CrossFit | Interesting Other | Nutrition Hacks | Performance Advice","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nitrate-rich-foods.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nitrate-rich-foods.jpg","Image Alt Text":"nitric oxide improves performance"},{"id":"1687","Title":"How to Get Started in The Paleo Diet","Meta Description":"Learn how to get started on the paleo diet and tailor its key diet principles to better your nutrition and overall health.","Content":"The “Caveman Diet,” aka Paleo diet has one simple goal–to eat like our paleolithic ancestors did.

We also suffer from stress, sleep deprivation, and a myriad of preventable diseases.<a href=\"http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2010/10/04/the-beginners-guide-to-the-paleo-diet/\"><sup>1</sup></a> Our ancestors didn’t have problems with obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, Type-2 diabetes, osteoporosis, or other autoimmune diseases and ailments.<a href=\"http://livinggreenmag.com/2013/10/03/food-health/if-the-paleo-diet-is-so-good-why-did-cavemen-die-so-young-a-look-at-the-pros-and-cons/\"><sup>2</sup></a> Clearly something is not right. The Paleo Diet is an effort to go back to eating what we were biologically designed to eat–allowing us to tap into our genetic potential and start living healthier immediately.<a href=\"http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2010/10/04/the-beginners-guide-to-the-paleo-diet/\"><sup>1</sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, how do you get started? Eat clean, eat well, eat plentiful. Paleo is based upon anything that we can hunt or find and is unprocessed.\n\nIncluding:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Lean meats, fish</li>\n\t<li>Eggs</li>\n\t<li>Leafy greens, veggies/fruit</li>\n\t<li>Healthy fats</li>\n\t<li>Nuts/seeds</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nDoes not include:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Dairy</li>\n\t<li>Grains</li>\n\t<li>Legumes,</li>\n\t<li>Excess sugar</li>\n\t<li>Vegetable Oils</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nPaleo diets should be high in healthy fat, moderate in animal proteins, and low to moderate in carbohydrates.<a href=\"http://greatist.com/health/ultimate-guide-eating-paleo-infographic\"><sup>3</sup></a> Saturated fats like coconut oil, avocado oil, olive oil, and macadamia oil are important to know. Also, your body needs time to adapt to this new diet so don’t be shocked if there is an initial drop in energy levels as your body gets used to not having spikes in sugars and glucose. Over time you will find that levels are restored and improved. Also, if you are need of a quick Paleo snack, proteins like turkey, chicken, or nuts are great. But, if you feel the cravings coming on–grab some AMRAP bars (100% Paleo), they provide you with clean, nutritious energy that will help you refuel and power through your day.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPaleo eating is naturally devoid of high concentrations of sugar, salt, dyes, dairy, preservatives, gluten, and grain. Paleo foods are rich in nutrients, phytochemicals, and mineral profiles. They can also increase the body’s ability to become stronger, healthier and more ready to express an improved physiologic and athletic performance. These fresh food groups are better for our bodies since they provide antioxidants, energy, and the potential to improve the immune system, decrease inflammation, and improve digestion as well as cognitive function.<a href=\"http://robbwolf.com/2014/08/20/paleo-diet-improved-athletic-performance/\"><sup>4</sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Paleo diet will take getting used to. Turning back the dial is hard, but we know that you’ll see tremendous changes in your overall health: with higher energy levels, improved athletic performance, sharper cognitive abilities, and a better body composition. A smart Paleo diet is designed to help you become the best version of yourself. Its not for everyone–if it were easy, everybody would do it. It’s a commitment to a healthy diet and lifestyle. So, if you’re up for the challenge, then the Paleo diet is the right choice for you!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured Image: <a href=\"http://www.easypaleo.com\" target=\"_blank\">EasyPaleo.com</a></h4>\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences\n<ol>\n\t<li>Steve Kamb (October 4, 2014). <em>The Beginners Guide to the Paleo Diet.</em> Retrieved from: http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2010/10/04/the-beginners-guide-to-the-paleo-diet/</li>\n\t<li>Laura Van Wert (October, 2013). <em>If the Paleo Diet Is So Good, Why Did Cavemen Die So Young?

Based on my experience, here are the best tips for endurance training running.","Content":"Endurance sports are pretty popular these days. Marathons, Triathlons, Spartan Races, GoRuck Challenges, the list goes on and on. Most inspiring athletes that I meet want to attempt their first marathon, and some of the wilder ones want to try a full on Ironman or Ultramarathon.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI’ve run five marathons, four half marathons, and an ultra marathon. I’m a healthy amateur, a naive enthusiast. I’m your average American endurance athlete. Recently I started endurance training under the Boston Bound marathon program. The good news is I made it to the end; the better news is I learned a great deal about myself from it. I will tell you that if I can do it, so can you. The first thing I will say before we move forward is this--Have some standard. It’s important for endurance training–it’ll keep you moving forward. It’ll make you faster. It’ll keep you healthy. Constant moderate athletic training literally strengthens your DNA on a cellular level. Your cells will replicate less frequently–all 37.2 trillion of them.<a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/there-are-372-trillion-cells-in-your-body-4941473/%20\"><sup>1</sup></a> You’ll <em>actually</em> live longer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSecond, Endurance training is a lot to take in and you need to be informed. You will improve your performance gains if you learn a few key concepts before training. There may be a quiz afterwards. Here are some the concepts I found most useful:\n\n<em>Anaerobic</em>: Short-term endurance exercise. This will be exercise that is performed very close to lactate threshold (higher intensity) and lasts for a much shorter period of time, usually around 1 to 3 minutes.\n\n<em> Aerobic</em>: Long-term endurance exercise. This is exercise that is performed further from the lactate threshold (lower intensity) and lasts for a much longer period of time, usually more than thirty consecutive minutes.\n\n<em>VO2 Max</em>: A measurement of how much oxygen your body is able to consume and use efficiently while exercising. Stated in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute. Solely having a high VO2 max does not necessarily mean you will be extremely capable in terms of endurance performance, as performance will also depend on your individual lactate threshold.<a href=\"http://www.sport-fitness-advisor.com/endurancetraining.html\"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup> <a href=\"http://www.sport-fitness-advisor.com/endurancetraining.html\"><sup>3</sup></a>\n\n<em>Lactate Threshold</em>: How rapidly your body is able to remove the waste product of lactic acid (produced in higher intensity). If your body is efficient at removing this waste, then you will be able to exercise for a much longer period of time. If you are looking to improve upon your performance, training to increase your VO2 max and lactate threshold is beneficial. It’s like recovering from the sprint while you’re still in the marathon.<a href=\"http://www.sport-fitness-advisor.com/endurancetraining.html\"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a href=\"http://www.sport-fitness-advisor.com/endurancetraining.html\"><sup>5</sup></a>\n\n<em>Glycolysis System</em>, Endurance training relies largely upon this, the energy system that takes place with the presence of oxygen and can burn carbohydrates and fat compounds for fuel. It’s only when you push it to high intensity that you’ll begin to approach your lactate threshold or VO2 max. Glycolysis is the sugar breakdown, the energy releaser, and the pyruvic intermediate.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow that you know your body, let’s hit the road and pound some pavement. The Boston Bound program will get you <em>Boston Strong</em> in no time. Well, maybe in about 13 weeks. Here are a few pointers from the great Hal Higdon for Boylston Street success in Boston.<a href=\"http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51230/Marathon-Boston-Bound-Training-Program\"><sup>6</sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Monday</strong>: Easy. Days with short runs that begin at 3 miles in the first week, and then move upward to 4-5 miles. The main purpose of the workout is to do some easy miles while recovering from a hard workout and getting ready for another one. Do this on a treadmill, and then do some strength training. Run between 65-75% of your maximum heart rate (MHR).\n\n<strong>Tuesday</strong>: Fast. Run fast 800 repeats at the track, or hill repeats that could be almost any length between 200-800 meters, as long as running up it pushes you into the 80-90% maximum zone. Because Boston is a downhill course, run every 3rd repeat downhill to strengthen your legs for the gravity pounding they’ll get in the marathon–that’s a lot of net force. You can’t fight it, but you can train for it.\n\n<strong>Wednesday</strong>: Easy. Similar to Mondays, do a short and easy run today, coupling this run with some stretching and strength training (weightlifting, calisthenics). Stay in the 65-75% comfort zone.\n\n<strong>Thursday</strong>: Fast. You’ll do a Tempo Run these days. Tempo Runs are where you start easy at a jogging warm-up pace 60-70%, then after 1-2 miles, begin to gradually accelerate to 80-90% of your maximum heart rate. Then, after holding that fast pace for 3-5 minutes, gradually decelerate and finish the run at the same pace you started.\n\n<strong>Friday</strong>: Rest. This is your R&amp;R day in the program. You need to be well rested to obtain maximum benefit from the tougher workouts on the weekends. You’ll thank me later. Trust me. Get injured and your dreams fall faster than a miler’s pace.\n\n<strong>Saturday</strong>: Pacing. Runs vary from 4-8 miles with half of them done at marathon pace, aim for 75-80% MHR. Do several test races, measure your fitness level and to provide motivation. Do a 5K or 10K and even a half marathon. Pace yourself, do the laps. Make ‘em count.\n\n<strong>Sunday</strong>: Long. Run your best effort. It doesn’t matter how far or fast you run in your allotted time; just get running. Stay in the 65-75% MHR zone. Your goal at Boston also should be to finish faster, or as fast, as you started out. Aim for negative splits, it’s what the pros do.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo now you’re educated and you have a plan. Here are some tips: Shorter runs are from 2-12 miles. Longer runs are from 12-24 miles. You never run 26 milers until race day. It’s bad luck. Plus, runners always need a little naivety during their marathon. It’ll keep you jovial, and competitively arrogant. You’re going to need it. Running 26.2 is crazy. To some it may even seem insignificant. But it’s very important that you do it. As for me, I follow suit with the legendary Ultra runner David Goggins: “I’ve done a lot of things that I thought were impossible. And, nothing’s impossible anymore.”\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFeatured Image By: Gregory J Fisher\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences\n<ol>\n\t<li>Eveleth, Rose (2013, October 24) <em>History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places | Smithsonian</em>.

While holding to the many health benefits above, beets introduce a new class of vegetable that no athlete or health conscious mind could refuse. With a full spectrum of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other beneficial nutrients in just a single serving—you too can enjoy the little things. For a single serving of just one cup, beets will provide you a few initial perks: <a href=\"http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=49\"><sup>1</sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>75 calories</li>\n\t<li>3 grams of protein</li>\n\t<li>16 grams of carbohydrates</li>\n\t<li>4 grams of fiber</li>\n\t<li>148 grams of water</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's not the macronutrients that deliver the most impressive health benefits. It’s the micronutrients that are going to blow you away. Take this table of benefits for example.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Table 1- Vitamin and mineral values for beets</strong>\n<table width=\"241\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Vitamins/Minerals</td>\n<td width=\"82\">Amount/serv.</td>\n<td width=\"51\">DRI/DV</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Folate</td>\n<td width=\"82\">136mcg</td>\n<td width=\"51\">34%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Manganese</td>\n<td width=\"82\">550mcg</td>\n<td width=\"51\">27.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Potassium</td>\n<td width=\"82\">518mg</td>\n<td width=\"51\">14.8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Copper</td>\n<td width=\"82\">130mcg</td>\n<td width=\"51\">14.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Magnesium</td>\n<td width=\"82\">39mg</td>\n<td width=\"51\">9.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Phosphorus</td>\n<td width=\"82\">65mg</td>\n<td width=\"51\">9.2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Sodium</td>\n<td width=\"82\">131mg</td>\n<td width=\"51\">8.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Vitamin C</td>\n<td width=\"82\">7mg</td>\n<td width=\"51\">8.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Iron</td>\n<td width=\"82\">2mg</td>\n<td width=\"51\">8.0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Vitamin B6</td>\n<td width=\"82\">110mcg</td>\n<td width=\"51\">6.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Vitamin B2</td>\n<td width=\"82\">70mch</td>\n<td width=\"51\">5.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Vitamin B1</td>\n<td width=\"82\">50mcg</td>\n<td width=\"51\">4.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Selenium</td>\n<td width=\"82\">1.2mcg</td>\n<td width=\"51\">2.2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"107\">Zinc</td>\n<td width=\"82\">600mcg</td>\n<td width=\"51\">5.4%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom a health standpoint, beets are a force to be reckoned with when it comes to a nutrient dense food source. With a high dose of manganese and vitamin C, these antioxidants in combination with a complete range of 18 different amino acids help your body process and repair. With branch chain amino acids (BCAA), Essential amino acids (EAA), and Non-essential amino acids (NEAA)—they’ve got your muscles covered. <a href=\"http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=49\"><sup>1</sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut the most important health aspect to beets is their phytonutrient contents. Beets have a very unique phytonutrient that goes by the name of betalain. There are two basic types of betalains, one being betacyanins and the other betaxanthins. These two phytonutrients are responsible for the true color of the beets themselves. Betacyanins give the red-violet color you commonly see, while the betaxanthins give off a certain yellow color. You can tell just by the color of the beet which of the two phytonutrients is most dominant. The two most reputable, and highly studied betalains within beets are betanin— a betacyanin, as well as vulgaxanthin—a betaxanthin. These two phytonutrients are what provide the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and detox support within this single red plant. <a href=\"http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=49\"><sup>1</sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can do more than fight inflammation with food like beets. One of the more popular topics of conversation with the beet is their high nitrate content that can attribute to lower blood pressure and an increase in stamina. In the human diet we receive about 60-80% of nitrates (NO3-) from plant and vegetable sources. Oral consumption is the most efficient way to increase nitric oxide production within the body. By ingesting inorganic nitrates the body is then able to convert those nitrates into nitrites from enzymes within the mouth and throat, and finally the stomach takes those nitrites and produces nitric oxide. Just with the nitrate consumption from a serving of beets, you are able to reduce the O2 cost of submaximal exercise and improve the efficiency of your muscle’s oxidative metabolism.<a href=\"http://jap.physiology.org/content/107/4/1144\"><sup>2</sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured Image By: www.agardenforahouse.com</h4>\n\n<hr />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReferences\n<ol>\n\t<li>The Worlds Healthiest Foods.

There are some creative commercial blends out there, but they can be expensive. Here's the wonderful secret: flavored nut butters are SUPER DUPER easy to make. This recipe uses cashews, which get nice and creamy when blended, with cumin (my favorite spice!), a touch of cayenne, and a hint of honey. The result is a spicy-sweet-salty combination that's tasty and good for you. In less than 5 minutes, unsalted nuts go from bland to <em><strong>BAM!</strong></em> and this recipe is friendly and forgiving; you can make it with almonds, pecans, sunflower seeds, or a blend of nuts to create your own personal flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/almondbutter.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1958\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/almondbutter-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"almondbutter\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Spicy Cashew Butter</strong>\n\n<strong>Ingredients:</strong>\n1 1/2 cups unsalted, dry roasted cashews\n1 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n1/2 – 1 tablespoon honey, to taste\n\n<strong>Directions:</strong>\n1.

Sweet, creamy, delicious, and an excellent source of healthy fat.","Content":"Dried, unsweetened coconut cannot compare to the fresh, tender, lightly sweet, oh-so-creamy texture of fresh coconut that you've cracked and grated with your own two hands (and some very common tools).\n\nUntil recently, my \"technique\" for cracking open a coconut was to put it in the sink, hope for the best, and bash it with a hammer until it stopped being so darn stubborn.\n\nNow I've found a better way. Good news! You still get to use a hammer.\n\n<strong>How to Crack a Fresh Coconut</strong>\n1. Preheat the oven to 350F.\n\n2. Place the coconut on a kitchen towel for traction. Pierce the three “eye” holes on top of the coconut by <em>gently</em> tapping a clean screwdriver with a hammer. This is much easier than it seems.\n<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/coconut1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1962\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/coconut1-225x300.png\" alt=\"coconut1\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n3. Drain the water from the coconut— you can catch it in a glass and drink it, if that's your thing — and put the coconut in the oven, directly on the oven rack, for 10 minutes.\n\n4. Remove the coconut from the oven, wrap it in a kitchen towel, place it in the sink, and smack it with a hammer to crack the shell. The white coconut meat should easily pop out of the thick shell. You might need to hit the pieces a few more times to break them into smaller, more manageable chunks; wrap the pieces in the towel every time.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/coconut2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1963\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/coconut2-300x200.png\" alt=\"coconut2\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>\n\n5. You can either remove the thin brown skin with a vegetable peeler or just leave it on. (It doesn't seem to affect flavor or texture if you leave it on.)\n\n6. Now you can either shred the coconut in a food processor or with a box grater, or make “chips” with a mandoline slicer (so later you can make these <a href=\"http://theclothesmakethegirl.com/2011/06/13/carmelized-coconut-chips/\" target=\"_blank\">Caramelized Coconut Chips</a>).

These trainers work through unique and differing challenges with all injured athletes in their gym.\n\nHow do they do this? CrossFit’s corporate office helped—donating all the equipment to this unpretentious box space. But really the methodology guides most of the work.\n\nThe daily workout for gym members is the same.  And this is where the genius of CrossFit’s methodology gets special. The fundamentals of training offer ultimate scalability and are applied to each athlete in respect to their injury or limitation. The workouts may be modified, but these athletes get to business.\n\nFor the first time since their injury, military athletes are building their bodies back to 100% pre-injury fitness levels. Some even surpass their previous fitness levels. It’s almost unimaginable for\n\nNot many therapy programs like this exist for wounded military veterans. <a href=\"http://www.crossfitwalterreed.com\" target=\"_blank\">CrossFit Walter Reed</a> offers more to military men and women than physical regeneration; it gives athletes a chance to regain the blow to their ego and build an empathetic network.\n\nIn a group environment, where everyone is subjected to similar duress and physical struggle, a renewed camaraderie is created with the gym community; something many of these athletes lost after their service career ended.\n\nThis video demonstrates hope and genuine satisfaction. CrossFit has become an invaluable place for our country’s servicemen and women to regain what has been lost.  The trainers at <a href=\"http://www.crossfitwalterreed.com\" target=\"_blank\">CrossFit Walter Reed </a>are inspiring a movement, and we at AMRAP support it wholeheartedly.\n\nShare what they are doing well.

Okay, yeah this list is spot on.  Tell yourself that self-awareness is a good thing and keep reading.\n\nEven if you are not overtly insane about CrossFit, you will be surprised that a number of these still describe you. Probably more than you would like to admit. We are right there with you.\n\nLike number 8.\n\nYes, we do get nervous before workouts. The difference is, we sit in our office or our car, not basements. Also, who is ever excited about a jog? Maybe your dog, but he gets just as excited about poo. A simple jog means little especially if you don’t have the common sense of urgency and duress as you get in the CrossFit group.\n\nAnd to be fair, summer swim team meets in sixth grade were just as exhilarating. At AMRAP, we have to ask, isn’t it nice to feel revved up about something as much as you were as a hormonal pre-teen? Yes. It is.\n\nSo don’t feel completely ashamed. There are good elements to this list. You’ll see.\n\nLike number 12.\n\nThis is one we have serious beef with and thank you Greatist for pointing it out. Protein shakes are bad, why?  CrossFit at its fundamental level has always intended to differentiate athletic performance from the rest. Good nutrition has always been at the core of CrossFit. Yet, with time bad habits have formed. And it really needs to stop. Athletes are not making informed choices. Most of their supplements stink\n\nAt AMRAP, we have made a concerted effort to return ourselves and other CrossFit back to basics. There is no reason to be eating a milkshake disguised as a health supplement or snickers disguised as a protein bar. In fact, we made our own nutritional supplement solution. A full line of nutrient dense supplements to deliver our bodies the fuel necessary for continued long-term performance. Not to brag, but the gains our bodies have seen on this stuff compared to the thinly disguised sugar pills put is in “beast mode”.

During my semester internship at AMRAP Nutrition, I learned healthy habits and skills that I will carry with me for life. Here's a few of my favorite takeaways from my time in the company fray.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<i>“Everyone involved in this project bring several talents and skills from a wide array of backgrounds.

Eating unhealthy isn’t my thing, I just can’t do it anymore. I personally boycotted fast-food years ago, and since working here, I’ve been moving forward with my goal of transitting to a 100% Paleo diet–I believe in the template that much.

I’m faster, stronger, and more healthy than I’ve ever been before.\n\nSelling product is only easy if you believe in its power to benefit others. I learned that this fall.

Never great news, even if you are not training for the CrossFit Games. After collapsing in a workout, Lindy was diagnosed with 3 spinal diseases and told to take up a different sport with less impact on her lower back--like endurance running for example. Not exactly sure where the logic came for that conclusion. However, we do know that Lindy Barber competed in the 2013 CrossFit Games.\n\nWhat the what? How did she manage it? That was the first question I thought. Almost immediately, the second question came to mind: is she being reckless?\n\nNo, not exactly and here’s why.\n\nLindy took a calculated risk coming back to CrossFit after her injury. Emotionally, I get her. She has been an athlete her entire life; Lindy loved competition. She lived for it. Naturally, she was unwilling to accept her diagnosis as a crutch that would rule her daily decisions.\n\nShe had a mission to overcome injury. The end of that mission was the finish line of 90 foot weighted lunge at the CrossFit Regionals competition. What she did with her fitness before then made all the difference.\n\nShe recovered slowly and rebuilt her body gradually. Lots of walks, lots of pushups and pullups--strict to build muscular strength again around her injury.\n\nLindy allowed two years of recovery and physical strengthening. She refused to have an injury refine her potential and worked consistently to make her solution. After two years she made it to the Games.\n\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWwobEbaac4[/embed]\n\nThe will not be everyone’s story. Some injuries or limitations might make it impossible to get to your pre-injury potential. The keyword is <i>might</i>. You have more control over your fitness and health than anyone else. Deal with everyday, but don’t allow injury to define who you are or who you can be in life.\n\nThat’s our philosophy at AMRAP Nutrition.

It happens. That’s what Scott Ziegler was told the day he walked into a Detroit Fire Department.\n\nIt just so happened to be true. That first day was trial by fire; house after house, his six man crew stomped out fires. Ziegler was nearly overrun. He put his crew was at a terrible disadvantage.\n\nThe firefighting industry is inscrutably team-oriented. Each member is essential to the process and continued stamina of the group. There’s no time or energy to spare for extra weight. Zieglar’s weight needed to go. In this case, it was actually life-threatening to the whole group.\n\nToday, Zieglar is still a firefighter. He is also a CrossFit coach. Why did he choose CrossFit to get in shape? What about running or weightlifting? Here’s how he put it:\n\n<i>“In Crossfit, just like firefighting, we use every muscle in our body. The workout literally defines itself as a program that will best prepare trainees for any physical contingency.”</i>\n\nIf Zieglar had followed a more conventional path to weight-loss and muscle strengthening, his body composition would surely improve especially if paired with proper nutrition. Still, he would be lacking the most important component of fitness: functional movement and high intensity endurance.\n\n<i>“Every workout you do in a Crossfit gym will push your body in a way similar to what a house fire does. It will push you to the point of pure exhaustion. And if you train your body to push past that while you are off duty, you will be that much better at doing it when it really matters.”</i>\n\nThe only way Zieglar can say that he has the best job in the world is if he is physically prepared to meet its demands. CrossFit helped him get there.\n\nMore than that, CrossFit’s constant variance keeps it interesting and engaging. Our company uses the fitness methodology to get more out of our day. We aren’t slaying fires in urban Detroit, but we are mobbing down mountain bike trails, hiking with our kids, and skiing in the backcountry.\n\nEnjoy the active parts of your life; follow AMRAP to get more insight and support for your improved health and fitness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRead the Original article <a href=\"http://uniformstories.com/articles/opinion-category/crossfit-can-make-you-a-better-firefighter\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>","Slug":"crossfit-training","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/crossfit-training/","Path":"/interesting_other/crossfit-training/","Date":"2014-10-24","Year":"2014","Month":"10","Day":"24","Categories":"Interesting Other","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Firefighter.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Firefighter.jpg","Image Alt Text":"CrossFit Training"},{"id":"2358","Title":"How to Supplement Your Diet Without Hidden Reverse Effects","Meta Description":"Comparing fast food to performance supplements sounds dramatic, but the American health crisis is proof of this problem. Avoid common unhealthy supplements.","Content":"<h2>The Similarities Between Fast Food and Performance Supplements is Shocking</h2>\n<h2></h2>\nIf you won’t eat fast-food because of how unnatural and unhealthy it is, why would you take supplements without checking the ingredients? Television ads, magazine articles, and promotional marketing peddle some pretty horrific chemicals looking for a quick-buck for \"fools\" seeking a quick-fix. Even if you make the added effort to read the label on your protein powder or pre-workout, manufacturers often hide chemical additives. While it sounds dramatic comparing fast food to performance supplements, the health crisis in America is proof of this problem.\n\nFirst, remember that there are no shortcuts to a healthy lifestyle. Results aren’t instantaneous. The tortoise beats the hare, the rabbit is smarter than the panther, and all things worth achieving takes hard work and sacrifice. Learn how to avoid health traps via bad supplements by first understanding the risks of processed performance supplements.\n\nNutritional supplements and various medications may have severe side effects on your body. Don’t buy them without thinking of the consequences of these products. One quick Google search, and you'll find  that most supplements are never as healthy as as they seem.<a href=\"http://listdose.com/10-reasons-to-say-no-to-those-health-supplements/\">1</a> Consuming them can lead to common side effects:\n<ul>\n\t<li>     Liver Damage</li>\n\t<li>     Kidney Failure</li>\n\t<li>     Heart Attacks</li>\n\t<li>     Risk of Cancer</li>\n\t<li>     Addison’s Disease</li>\n\t<li>     Anosmia</li>\n\t<li>     Weight Loss</li>\n\t<li>     Erectile Dysfunction</li>\n\t<li>     Odorous Gas</li>\n</ul>\nHere’s what the American College of Physicians have to say about the supplements you’re using:\n\n“Their use is not justified, and they should be avoided. Supplementing the diet of well-nourished adults with (most) mineral or vitamin supplements has no clear benefit and might even be harmful. These vitamins should not be used for chronic disease prevention...In fact, some supplements even cause harm, such as high doses of vitamins A and E that may increase risk of death.”<a href=\"http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1789253\">2</a>\n\nStop taking supplements that you don't understand or can't trust. Go for natural unprocessed nutrient rich foods. Eat Paleo! Eating food with high-quality meats, seafood, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds provide you with nearly all the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients your body needs. That said, there is a place for select food-based supplements, like omega oils, super greens, beet concentrate, that can make up for nutrient deficiencies in your diet and promote positive changes in the body.\n\nA tried and true rule of thumb: If you can’t even pronounce the ingredients on the back labels–you shouldn’t consume them–they’re probably made in a laboratory. Don’t be a lab-rat.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Parulkhani, (2014, March 12). <i>10 Reasons to Say No to Those Health Supplements</i>.

The real story though is not so neatly written.\n\nShari will be the first to admit, at one point in her life she was a wreck. She lost the first half of her life to addiction, and now she’s starting over.\n\n<i>“If I don’t do something, I am going to die.” </i>\n\nShari came to a point in her life where she needed to find a way to dig herself out of her current pit. Shari got clean at 24. At first she started running. Drug addicts have a gap for the yearning. For her, running started to fill the yearning gap. then came CrossFit.\n\n“You are going to be addicted to something in your life. The only way you change negative behavior is to channel that energy in a positive direction.”\n\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vkOCqVM3E4[/embed]\n\nFor Shari, CrossFit was a positive extension for her addictive personality. It is highly intense and constantly challenging. CrossFit is an outlet for natural human tendencies to reach a full color experience, so to speak. It can be made even more powerful when it changes the pattern of someone’s downward spiral and turns them into a force for good.\n\nToday, the bad in Shari’s early life fuels her daily efforts. She overdosed, dumpster dived, lost her fiance to drugs, but Shari found a way to use those experiences to empower herself and others.\n\nShe is thankful to run, to work for clients that can identify with her experience, and mostly to have the energy to raise her kids.\n\nIts up to her to change to pattern for her kids. She ensures their future with her honest past experience and positive outlook. Her daughter graduated with honors and is going to college and her son is on the same track.\n\nWe believe that fitness is a powerful tool for every person, no matter when they recognize it.

This is not a joke. Its time to understand how you are feeding your body and how it should be nourished.\n\n<strong><strong> </strong></strong>\n\nTaken from Paleolithic history, human bodies have adapted by learning to hold onto their most efficient fuel source until it was most needed. And that is why we store fat on our bodies. But we can teach our bodies to use this stored fuel instead of just holding onto it. Once you’ve become fat adapted, you’re body will literally begin to shed excess weight.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<i>“By switching to a high fat, low carbohydrate Paleo diet, you can teach your body to begin using it’s fat stores as energy. Essentially you become a fat burning machine.”</i>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne caveat.  Losing weight requires a calorie deficit.  Most of the foods listed below are higher in calories due to their high fat content. The biggest benefit to these foods is that they will satiate your hunger, making you want to eat less.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLong lasting fuel for the busy athlete is the main focus at AMRAP Nutrition. Using the same ideal carb to fat ratio, AMRAP Bars come in three flavors and offer you the nutrition to become fat adapted and churn fat stores into energy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYour body demands variety as much as it does fat.

My most valued piece of advice, especially when first transitioning to Paleo, is to keep meals simple.","Content":"One of the things that I have had difficulty with on the Paleo diet was how much effort it took incorporating it into my life. I currently work a full-time job and have hobbies and activities on top of that, as I'm sure most people do. Completely changing your lifestyle can not only be stressful, but it can make it easy to revert back to old habits due to the simple fact that it may not be sustainable in the long run. Well, I'm here to tell you that the Paleo diet can not only be sustainable, it can actually be stress-free and less time-consuming when planned appropriately! It's time to be clever about meal planning if you want to establish a reliable routine.\n\nWhen beginning any new task, I tend to over-organize. My job requires me to micro-manage everything, and I take pride in accomplishing that most of the time. Because I enjoy it and am successful at it, I tend to have this same mentality in my personal life as well. I have learned that by pre-planning and by tackling the biggest time-consuming tasks at a time when you have the most free time, it can make for a smooth and organized work week.\n\nHere are some steps that I still continue to practice to this day that have made it that much easier to stick to my health routines:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Make a plan. Create a meal plan for the week so that there are no surprises, and so you know what you need to purchase when buying groceries for that week. Not only will you save money by only buying what you need, you also won't be tempted to eat that chocolate ice cream you bought at the grocery store \"just in case\" because it won't be on your list (at least we hope!). Making a list also means less time at the grocery store aimlessly wandering the aisles, wondering what the best choices are (you can find me doing that at any given time I don’t take the effort to write down what I need beforehand).</li>\n\t<li>Prepare as much as you can in advance. Twice a day, for breakfast and lunch, I have a fruit salad. Every Sunday, I wash, prepare, and cut all of my fruit so that I won't have to spend so much time throughout the week doing it. You wouldn't believe how much time this saves! It also keeps me accountable. I won't be tempted to make excuses as to why I didn't eat healthy (\"I didn't have time to prepare!\" If you're anything like me, you've used this excuse at some point). Sometimes I'll even portion out my fruit into smaller containers for each meal so that they are more grab-and-go. I also pack my lunch the night before so I'm not trying to put something together when I'm half-asleep in the morning. It wouldn't be a pretty sight. I'm in no way, shape, or form a morning person.</li>\n\t<li>Make multiple servings of everything. If you're planning on cooking one of your meals that week, cook it the night before or the first night that you start your work week and make plenty of leftovers! It's so much easier and quicker to only have to spend one night cooking away in the kitchen, as long as you don't mind the repetitiveness of having the same meal for dinner more than once a week.</li>\n\t<li>Don't try to be the next Emeril right away. I'm always so tempted to try and cook something extravagant from my meal plan the first week I've started. What ends up happening is me realizing that I don't have enough time laid out in the week to cook such complicated recipes, so I end up finding something quick, easy, and not that healthy to eat for dinner. Instead of reaching for the stars right away, ease into a routine. Once it becomes easy to manage, then tackle those recipes! It'll seem a lot easier to manage once you've adapted to the Paleo lifestyle.</li>\n\t<li>Always have something quick and easy to grab in an emergency. I used to make portioned bags of my own homemade trail mix that were super simple to throw together and were great to take with me just about anywhere. Just mix together a combination of any of these Paleo-friendly ingredients:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Almonds</li>\n\t<li>Pecans</li>\n\t<li>Walnuts</li>\n\t<li>Pumpkin seeds</li>\n\t<li>Sunflower seeds</li>\n\t<li>Dried cherries</li>\n\t<li>Dried apricots</li>\n\t<li>Raisins</li>\n\t<li>Apple chips</li>\n\t<li>Shredded coconut</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\nMy favorite trail mix combination is almonds, apple chips, raisins, and dried cherries. Yummy!\n\nIt's really important to plan when practicing any healthy lifestyle. If it were easy, everyone would do it! My most valued piece of advice, especially when first transitioning to Paleo, would be to keep it simple!\n\nHere's an example of one of my typical Paleo meal plans:\n\n<strong>Breakfast:\n</strong>-2 microwaved eggs (\"over hard\") seasoned with salt and pepper\n-2 cups of fresh fruit salad\n-Black coffee with Stevia and coconut milk\n\n<strong>Snack:\n</strong>-Trail mix (see above for ideas!)\n\n<strong>Lunch:\n</strong>-Garden salad (greens, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, shredded carrots) with olive oil and balsamic vinegar \"dressing\"\n-1/2-1 whole cooked sweet potato with cinnamon and butter\n\n<strong>Dinner:\n</strong>-Grilled chicken breast seasoned with dried seasonings\n-Steamed vegetables (broccoli, carrots, zucchini, summer squash) seasoned with salt and pepper\n\nThe Paleo diet can sometimes be hard to start, especially with some of the restrictions that the diet requires. By going \"back to basics\" and keeping it simple, you can make some lifestyle changes that will stick with you, and not quick \"fixes\" that may lead to going off-plan. Once you see the benefits of eating whole, real foods, the rest will fall into place!\n\nHappy planning!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured Image By: <a href=\"http://nomnompaleo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">nomnompaleo.com</a></h4>","Slug":"back-basics-clever-paleo-meal-planning","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/nutrition_hacks/back-basics-clever-paleo-meal-planning/","Path":"/nutrition_hacks/back-basics-clever-paleo-meal-planning/","Date":"2014-11-03","Year":"2014","Month":"11","Day":"03","Categories":"Nutrition Hacks","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/paleomealplanning.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/paleomealplanning.jpg","Image Alt Text":"paleomealplanning"},{"id":"2990","Title":"Round out Your Endurance Training With This Shark-Weekly WOD","Meta Description":"Swimming is crucial to any well-rounded athlete.

Great White Sharks are the apex predators of the deep blue sea. They’re carnivorous. They're hungry. And they’re even Paleo (okay, I'm kidding).<a href=\"http://visual.ly/shark-speed-worlds-fastest-sharks\">1</a> Although I don’t recommend going all ‘shark week’ on your Paleo diet, you ought to be diving into the pool and turning your guppy-like endurance into some serious apex strength.\n\nSwimming is crucial to any well-rounded athlete. The healing properties of water are fantastic, the fluid motion for your body is opulent and tranquil. The sub-surface elements can be exerting, but they’ll help build the inner shark inside of you too. In fact, your body exerts 75% more energy moving through water than it does air. Talk about a tough training session! If you can fight the fluid friction of the pool, you’re athletic prowess on land will increase exponentially–talk about <em>beast-mode.</em>\n\nGreat White Sharks swim about 25 miles/hour. While our finest Olympian, Michael Phelps, clocks in at about 5 miles/hour. However, sharks only have a cruising distance of about 1.5 miles in one hour, which means we’ve got them beat in endurance–ask any triathlete. You may not be able to outswim a shark, but you can out-train them! Let’s build up that endurance, shall we.\n\nIn order to boost swimming endurance you need to hop in the pool three times per week, allowing moderate rest in between and cross training. No need to speed through these workouts, just keep building on this water WOD with efficient form. Here’s a freestyle workout to get you started. As the weeks pass, continue to increase your mileage. When you’re ready, start swimming some different strokes.<a href=\"http://www.active.com/swimming/articles/6-sets-to-build-swimming-endurance\">2</a> Here's a great workout to start (and scale as needed):\n\nWOD Shark-Weekly\n<ul>\n\t<li>     Warm-up: 300 yards</li>\n\t<li>     3 x 100 yards — easy</li>\n\t<li>     Intervals: 400 yards</li>\n\t<li>     2 x 200 yards — build speed</li>\n\t<li>     Endurance: 400 yards</li>\n\t<li>     1 x 400 yards — moderate</li>\n\t<li>     Warm-down: 200 yards</li>\n\t<li>     4 x 50 yards — easy</li>\n\t<li>     Total: 1300 yards — easy.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Build-Endurance-Swim-Mile-7215546\">3</a></span></li>\n</ul>\nGet ready to swim with some Great Whites!

It’s a common thing that we’re all too familiar with. Any daily WOD or endurance race is bound to leave us feeling a little sore. Our muscles and bones are always at a constant war with gravity and friction. Earth is a rough place. And, since we can’t partake in Zero-G CrossFit just yet, we’ve still got to fight the furious flames inside of our bodies.\n\nPain, heat, redness, swelling, loss of function, and general soreness are all common types of inflammation.<a href=\"http://staceylovenlife.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/inflammation-and-nutrition/\">1</a> Ever wonder how pro athletes train, compete, and repeat for a living? They’re experts at controlling the inflammation in their bodies that would otherwise hinder their ability to trounce their competition. They eat right and in turn, their bodies allow them to train 6-7 days a week as hyper-successful athletes.\n\nInflammation is your body’s attempt to protect itself from harmful stimuli. Not only does it affect your body, but it impairs your cognitive abilities and can lead the declination of your overall mood. It’s also linked to Arthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Alzheimer’s. If you don’t play it safe and fight inflammation with the right food, you might as well quit playing. “You don’t get another chance, life is no Nintendo game.”<a href=\"http://thehealthyapple.com/anti-inflammatory-grocery-guide/\">2</a>\n\nBut, you've got me, so lucky you. When you stuff the right stuff into your stomach, inflammation becomes both preventable and treatable, and Autoimmune diseases may, in fact, become self-treatable. (A close friend of mine, was diagnosed with arthritis, after a paleo-nutrition makeover, she's now 100% arthritis-free. True story.) So listen up, this may just save you from the fire inside you.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Foods that cause inflammation:</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li> White Sugar, Sweets</li>\n\t<li> Alcohol</li>\n\t<li> Iodized Salt</li>\n\t<li> Fried Foods</li>\n\t<li> Dairy</li>\n\t<li> Wheats, Grains</li>\n\t<li> Processed, Packaged, and Not Paleo!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Foods that fight inflammation:</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Veggies: asparagus, beets, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, kale, mushrooms, onions, parsley, radish, spinach</li>\n\t<li>Fruits: apples, apricots, avocados, blackberries, blueberries, cantaloupe, cherries, honeydew melon, kiwi, lemon, lime, papaya</li>\n\t<li>Protein: chicken, eggs, turkey, trout, salmon, halibut,</li>\n\t<li>Beverages: herbal tea, green tea, purified water, coconut water</li>\n\t<li>Oils: coconut, grape seed, flax seed, avocado, &amp; walnut oil</li>\n\t<li>Nuts/Seeds: almonds, walnuts, cashews, macadamia nuts, and sesame, hemp, sunflower, &amp; ground flax seeds</li>\n\t<li>Condiments: fresh herbs, spices, sea salt, peppercorns.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"http://rap.genius.com/Eminem-love-the-way-you-lie-lyrics#note-18675\">3</a></span></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nEating healthy is important; follow an anti-inflammatory diet and give your body an opportunity to repair and rebuild inflamed areas.

Here's why...</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nCrossFit is the only reason I’ll step foot inside of a gym anymore. I’m not much of a gym guy; maybe you're the same. I love the outdoors. Nature is rough and beautiful. The elements are uncompromising. A rowing machine isn’t on a river. A treadmill is not the open road. I can’t run 26.2 on a quarter mile track. The stair stepper is not a mountain. But it makes my time outdoors actually enjoyable. I'm not huffing up the mountainside, like my lungs will burst from my chest at any given moment.\n\nThe one  piece of gym equipment that stands superior to most exercises either inside or outside of the gym is the kettlebell. No other device offer the kind of cast-iron, heavy feel, and ballistic benefits an active body needs. Kettlebell strength training will make you earn it. You’ve got to train hard and dirty, until your muscles bleed lactic acid. (Then cool down).\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Where did kettlebell strength training originate from?</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>“Nobody owes nobody nothing. You owe yourself.”</i></p>\nKettlebells made their way to Russia at the beginning of the 18th century, the kettlebell was used as a weight to measure grains and other goods. Russian culture views strength as an honorable quality so Russian Dr. Vladislav Kraevsky, the founder of heavy athletics, travelled through Europe gathering info about the physical culture of sports intending to find new ways to improve health, well-being, and physical education. Upon returning to the Motherland, the doctor introduced exercises with kettlebells and barbells to the Russian athletic community. The rest, as they say, is history.<a href=\"http://www.kettlebellscience.com/kettlebell-history.html\">1</a>\n\nThe best solutions are often the simplest, so no matter how technologically advanced gyms become, athletic technology peaked with the kettlebell. It has lead the pack of old-school training implements. Kettlebell  swings are metabolically demanding. They recruit a large muscle area, and reinforce key athletic movements like hip flexion and extension. Power exercises, like cleans and snatches will help you build champion coordination total-body strength. They’re not the easiest to master and require adequate technique as strength.<a href=\"http://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-routines/full-body-kettlebell-workouts\">2</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to apply kettlebells to your strength training regimen</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>“Going in one more round when you don’t think you can, </i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>that’s what makes all the difference in your life.”</i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i>Kettlebell Swing–targets shoulders, back, hips, glutes, and legs. (Lightweight) </i>How to: Stand up straight, with feet a bit wider than hip-distance apart. Grab the handle with both hands, keeping your palms face down and your arms in front of the body. Maintain a slight bend to the knee and drive the hips back, lowering the body. In a fluid motion, explosively drive the hips forward while swinging the kettlebell, keeping the glutes and core engaged. The motion should come from the hips as the body returns to standing. Lower the weight back down between the legs and keep this swinging motion going for more reps.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i>Goblet Squat–targets legs, glutes, and back. (Welterweight). </i>How to: Stand up straight, holding the kettlebell in front of the chest with both hands, keeping the elbows close to the body. Start squatting by driving the heels into the ground and pushing the hips back until the thighs are parallel to the ground or just below. Return to standing, and repeat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i>Russian Twist–targets abs, and obliques. Level: (Middleweight). </i>How to: Sit with the legs bent and feet flat on the floor, about hip-distance apart. Hold the kettlebell with both hands at the chest, and then lean back to a 45-degree angle. Rotate the torso from left to right by twisting at the waist and swinging the kettlebell across the body.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i>Single-Arm Snatch–targets: Shoulders, chest, back. (Heavyweight). </i>How to: Start with a kettlebell between the feet with the knees bent. Explode onto your toes the kettlebell until it reaches your chest with your elbow tucked in.

Combat poor performance with 3 cycling endurance training tips.","Content":"<h2>Cycling endurance training meets powerlifting</h2>\nCycling is key to building leg muscles that are energy efficient and meticulously strong. Building this endurance is your salvation to fighting poor cycling performance. To endure when you’re fatigued. Cycling is an aerobic activity. It involves free oxygen and denoting exercise that improves the efficiency of your body's cardiovascular system when absorbing and transporting oxygen. As your bike fights through the friction of the wind, your body fights for oxygen, thrives on it.\n\nStrengthening cycling endurance improves your muscles intake valves, those organically mechanical machines that fuel your muscles and fan your wheel power. It also improves your efficiency, as your stronger muscles work together with increased finesse, their movements more fluid. It's actually pretty cool. Trust me, there's a science to all of this.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Cycling Anatomy:</h3>\n<i>Power Phase–</i>From the top pedal position, cyclists utilize their hip extensors, the gluteus maximus muscle,  initiating the power-phase. Then, the knee extensors activate, vastus lateralis and vastus medialis, generating force, which is prominent while out of the saddle on vertical gradients. Then, plantar flexion occurs due to the gastrocnemius muscle, pointing the toes outwards.\n\n<i>Recovery Phase–</i>The tibialis anterior draws the toes up towards the shins, a dorsiflexion motion<b>. </b>Then, the semimembranosus, semitendinosus and biceps femoris pull the heel upwards toward the buttocks<b>. </b>Finally, your hip flexors of the liacus and Psoas finish off the pedal stroke.<a href=\"http://hubpages.com/hub/Muscles-groups-used-while-cycling\">1</a>\n\nEquilateral Efficiency:\n\n<i>Cycling Strength</i>–push pedals past that high resistance marker. Athletes with slow-twitch muscles possess serious pumping power–good for grinding up those vertical roads.\n\n<i>Cycling Speed</i>–turn pedals rapidly for those revolutions per minute. Athletes with fast-twitch muscles possess serious cheetah speed–highly developed–up to 150 rpms.\n\n<i>Cycling Power</i>–the bridge between both strength and speed: maximum force, minimal time. Think of it like equilateral efficiency. Tweak your muscles, and turn your wheels.<a href=\"http://cyclingtips.com.au/2009/09/speed-strength-and-endurance/\">2</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Training Regimen:</h3>\n<i>Long Rides:</i> 25-50% Your cycling training  needs one weekly long ride. The target of a long ride is to build up basic endurance by cycling long distances and building up mileage. Cycling long distances at this level  helps build your endurance by developing muscles that can push on for hours.\n\n<i>Interval Rides: </i>50-75% Interval rides develop speed, and aerobic/anaerobic capacity, and resistance to fatigue at high speeds. Keeping short recovery periods between the sprints allows more training at these speeds. A great target is to develop maximal speed for shorter endurance distances.This is beneficial for lowering your heart rate.\n\n<i>Tempo Rides:</i> 75-100%. Tempo rides develop powerful aerobic capacity and resistance to fatigue. The tempo parts recommended to be ridden at top speeds in order to build fatigue resistance at typical racing speed and to improve performance in the lactate threshold.<a href=\"http://www.polar.com/us-en/support/tips/Endurance_Program_for_Cycling\">3</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Lesson Learned:</h3>\nKnowledge about cycling endurance is a win-win scenario. You’ll become a smarter, more efficient cyclist. Your body will thank you later as the benefits of cycling are profoundly healthy. “The bicycle is the most efficient machine ever created: converting calories into gas, a bicycle gets the equivalent of three thousand miles per gallon.”<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/recuperandolacalle/25-quotes-about-urban-cycling\">4</a> Now, that's cool.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

He keeps the whole room excited about the <a href=\"http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/faq.html#General0\">WOD</a>.\n\n<strong>Strong, Silent Type (SST)</strong>\n\nYou know that guy who never smiles and rarely speaks? Yeah, he might have the last laugh. He’s all about the business at hand: Becoming a <a href=\"http://board.crossfit.com/showthread.php?t=52342\">fire-breather</a>.\n\nSST lets his reps do the talking — and it seems to be working for him. He’s quick to help, never verbose and devoted to his workout.\n\n<strong>Tough Mother (TM)</strong>\n\nThe Tough Mother is that tiny 35-year-old mom of three who roars into the box at the speed of light. She still needs to get home, make dinner, help the kids with homework and prepare for that big presentation at work.\n\nTM is 5-foot-nothing, 100-and-nothing, but she juggles a career, marriage, kiddos and much more with ease — so 3, 2, 1, GO doesn’t make her nervous. Not even a little.\n\n<strong>New Guy (NG)</strong>\n\nThe New Guy is really nervous as he tries to avoid embarrassing mistakes and stay out of people’s way. Little does he know that everyone around is simply super stoked that he decided to <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/product-category/amrap-bars/\">improve his lifestyle</a>.\n\nNG is afraid to ask questions but eager to learn, so offer good tips whenever possible.\n\n<strong>Loud and Proud (LP)</strong>\n\nAt first glance, Ms. Loud and Proud is all show. She grunts, screams and wails like a madwoman. She treats the box like her own personal megaphone.\n\nBut don’t be mad at her. She’s not trying to be the center of attention. It’s just that screaming works for her. It’s the best way for her to attack her GPP.\n\nYou probably know CrossFit folks who fit in these categories and others. Let’s value their differences.

The holiday season is upon us, which means more cookies and cakes than you can shake a sleigh bell at.\n\nFor those of us devoted to CrossFit fitness and the Paleo lifestyle, this <a href=\"http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/10/27/jon-oliver-rants-sugar-industry-last-week-tonight/\">seasonal sugar craze</a> is pretty gross and alarming.

Plus it drastically limits our day-to-day energy and vitality.\n\nBut seriously, unless you live in a cave, it’s impossible to put sugar completely outside your line of sight during the holidays. Here are a few ways to enjoy this special time of year while keeping your nutrition principles intact:\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Find recipes that are healthful and flavorful —</strong> The Internet is your friend as your search for <a href=\"http://www.thepaleomom.com/holiday-treats\" target=\"_blank\">Paleo-friendly holiday treats</a>.

Yes, that’s sugar — but at least it’s the kind our ancestors were eating.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Concentrate on working out — </strong>When your lazy uncle is sitting down to watch a third consecutive football game, why not head to the box? Even without refined sugar, chances are you’re eating a bit more food than usual. So, make up for the extra calories with a killer, beast-like performance at the gym.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Grab a bar on the run — </strong>In a pinch, don’t rely on whatever “naughty” food might be lying around your mother’s house. Be “nice” with a blitz of energy from a <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/shop/\">bar</a> or veggies.</li>\n</ul>\nNo one ever said the holiday season would be easy for Paleo eaters.

But, inflammation is part of the body’s natural immune response, it’s how we heal – it brings nourishment and immune reinforcements to the site of injury/infection. However, issues start to arise when inflammation persists and has no real purpose, often causing damage to the body and leading to illnesses such as chronic inflammation or rheumatoid arthritis. There are steroids and other treatments to try to combat chronic inflammation, but diet plays a very large role as well. Specific foods aid in reducing inflammation and it is important to be educated about which are the best for containing it and reducing your risk for future disease. Here at least seven of the best foods that fight inflammation in the body.1\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Fatty Fish</b>- Oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines. Their high content of Omega-3 fatty acids aid in reducing inflammation, to get benefits it must be eaten several times a week. If you’re not a fish fan, fish oil supplements are something to consider as well.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Dark Leafy Greens</b>- Vitamin-E is essential for fighting inflammation. Get your leafy greens on with dark green veggies such as spinach, kale, broccoli, and collard greens. Darker veggies also have higher concentrations of vitamins and minerals such as calcium, iron, and other disease fighting phytochemicals (occurring in plants).</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Nuts</b>- Almonds are high in fiber, calcium, and vitamin-E. Walnuts have alpha-linolenic acid, a type of Omega-3 fat. Nuts are packed with antioxidants that can help your body repair the damage caused by inflammation.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Peppers</b>- Color, color, color! Colorful veggies are important to your diet in general. They are high in antioxidants and help lower starch levels. Bell peppers come in many colors, and chili and cayenne pepper can be used as toppings. Despite their fiery flavor, they actually turn down the heat on inflammation!</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Fruit</b>- Especially berries. Fruits are low in fat and calories, high in antioxidants. Berries have anthocyanins, which aid in reducing inflammation and give them their rich color.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Beets</b>- or beet juice. You have to forgive these guys for their less than desirable Earthy flavor because honestly- they are simply amazing. Loaded with antioxidants, they reduce inflammation, protect against cancers and heart disease, lower blood pressure, and are even rich in fiber and vitamin C–what <i>can’t</i> these guys do? You need them in your life, and your body will continually thank you.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Other Options</b>- Ginger and turmeric, garlic and onions, soy, tomatoes which contain lycopene that help reduce inflammation in the lungs, tart cherries, tea, and extra virgin olive oil are all excellent.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat’s important is that most of these foods need to be eaten consistently. You can’t eat some fish and veggies for a night and expect to see dramatic changes. These foods are intended to help your body maintain optimal health while influencing the inflammatory process with the ultimate goal of reducing harmful inflammation. Incorporating these wonder foods into your diet is something to consider. Not only will your health improve because of the great benefits of anti-inflammatory foods, but they are the key to fighting the fire from the inside!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Featured Image By: Breakingmuscle.com</h4>\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences:\n<ol>\n\t<li> Amanda MacMillan (2013, June 19).

Oily fish like salmon, mackerel, tuna, and sardines should make up a regular portion of your meals because of their optimal health benefits. However, we know that not everyone is a fish fanatic. If you are one of those people and worry that you wont receive the health benefits, <i>fish oil supplements </i>are a great alternative to consider without having to taste our little fish friends.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFish oil contains high levels of Omega 3-Fatty Acids, including Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA). These acids are <i>especially important</i> to obtain from our diet because our body does not produce them naturally on its own.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt is great for your heart and blood, balancing cholesterol levels, protecting your bones, and promoting healthy brain function. We need Omega-3s as well as Omega-6s for healthy body function. It’s important to keep these two types of omegas in balance as they both work together in reducing inflammation and promoting cardiovascular health.1 Here are some more awesome benefits of fish oil:2\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>Helps prevent heart disease</li>\n\t<li>Lowers blood pressure</li>\n\t<li>Reduces inflammation</li>\n\t<li>Boosts immune system</li>\n\t<li>Lowers Triglycerides (fats related to cholesterol) for improved balance of cholesterol levels</li>\n\t<li>Promotes bone health and bone density</li>\n\t<li>Used to prevent Glaucoma, dry eyes, age-related Macular Degeneration</li>\n\t<li>Aids with autoimmune diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis and Lupus</li>\n\t<li>Used for Diabetes, Asthma, and pain and swelling</li>\n\t<li>Great for hair, skin, and nails</li>\n\t<li>“Brain food” – improves brain function, aids in mental health, boosts Serotonin production, manages stress</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe last bullet may be the best singular benefit of fish oil supplements. Fish oil benefits brain function in a large capacity and influences your long term health and physical performance. To reach your full potential, you need your wits about you.\n\nOne thing to be cautious of is the quality. When looking for fish oil pills, be sure to check for the highest quality and brands that have EPA <i>and</i> DHA content. With all of above benefits, it will help support the quality of your workouts and most importantly, improve your overall health. It’s okay to not like fish! What is important, however, is that you are getting all of the awesomeness that is fish oil into your body!

Overworked muscles result in muscle exhaustion and poor form that leads to injury. Recognize signs of overtraining.","Content":"<h2>If you are sleep-deprived and striving for better fitness, this is for you.</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nSo you want to make some changes in your life; you decide to start eating healthy and working out. Perhaps you find Paleo and CrossFit, which, here at AMRAP is our go to, or you simply start buy more veggies and Zumba more often, we don’t discriminate! Great food and great exercise? We are all for it. However, what we will scold you about is <em>rest</em>. You aren't giving your body enough of it. Lack of rest has a huge impact on your muscles, body, and athletic performance.\n\nMany people are focused on “getting big”- spending hours in the gym and pushing their bodies to the limits through intense strength training or cardiovascular exercise, which in turn can increase your strength and stamina and even improve your mental health. And while we do love your go-getter attitude, over time, you will find yourself in a mean confrontation with the symptoms of overworked muscles.\n\nOverworked muscles can result in muscle exhaustion and breakdown, poor form that leads to injury, and cause harm to your body - which is the exact opposite of what you are striving for. In order for your muscles to grow and expand, they need time to rest and repair.  Often, if you haven't given your body adequate rest, you'll actually see more benefit from skipping your daily workout. Rest days are important; when ignored, you'll have these symptoms to be aware of. 1\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Physical &amp; Mental Signs of Over-stress</b>:\n\nIt is common to experience sore muscles and joints. Overtraining can lead to increased fatigue, irritability, feeling out of sorts, and in extreme cases-heightened anxiety and depression. It also affects performance, for example: If you can normally perform 12 squats with a 40-pound barbell, you might only manage 8 to 10 squats.   Other things to take note of are changing moods, having trouble relaxing or sleeping, sickness and injury, aches and pains affecting work performance and increased appetite.\n\nOvertraining can happen to almost anyone-fit or unfit, young or old- that develops an imbalance between training and recovery. 2 Fatigue, soreness, injury, irritability, affected performance- it is easy to see the toll that poor rest takes on your body. Luckily, there are very easy and healthy ways to combat overtraining. Getting enough sleep, 8-9 hours a night is recommended and most importantly, if you are noticing signs of overtraining, be sure to take your <i>rest days</i>- at least one to two days between intense training to give your body proper time to recuperate.\n\nMy best advice? <i>Listen</i> to your body, it won’t steer you wrong. Our bodies are simply amazing, they can handle just about anything we put them through- but we must not forget they need their rest too. They support us from the moment we are born until it is our time to go, so don’t forget to love your body and give it the proper rest it deserves. Get your rest days in, your body will thank you and in return- it will allow for your continued success.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\nReferences\n<ol>\n\t<li>William McCoy (January 3, 2014). <i>How to Know if I’m Overworking Muscles.</i> Retrieved from http://www.livestrong.com/article/512309-how-to-know-if-im-overworking-muscles/</li>\n\t<li><i></i>Shannon Clark (August 15, 2014).  <i>How to Combat CNS Overtraining. </i>Retrieved from http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/how-to-combat-cns-overtraining.html</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;","Slug":"rest-days-important-dont-leave","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/everything_crossfit/rest-days-important-dont-leave/","Path":"/everything_crossfit/rest-days-important-dont-leave/","Date":"2014-12-14","Year":"2014","Month":"12","Day":"14","Categories":"Everything CrossFit | Lifestyle Design | Performance Advice","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sleepdeprivedhealtheffects.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SleepDeprivation_huffpost.png | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/o-SLEEP-DEPRIVATION-huffpost.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sleepdeprivedhealtheffects.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SleepDeprivation_huffpost.png | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/o-SLEEP-DEPRIVATION-huffpost.jpg","Image Alt Text":"sleepdeprivedhealtheffects | SleepDeprivationeffects | "},{"id":"3685","Title":"What the Gluten-Free Diet Fad Teaches You About Healthy Eating","Meta Description":"If you have celiac disease or not, adopt a form of the gluten free diet fad to avoid mass amounts of starchy carbohydrates and processed foods","Content":"<h2>Learn to Avoid Starchy Carbohydrates and Processed Foods Through Gluten Free Guides</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe gluten free diet is considered the new fad in health and nutrition. Many of you may be thinking how much you love (or hate) being gluten free, and how your health isn’t at risk anymore since switching over. But the truth is, most of people don’t know why they need a gluten-free diet, or even what celiac disease is.\n\nCeliac disease is severe. It is also very rare. You may be telling yourself “I have celiac disease”, but the reality is only 1 in 100 individuals have it. That said, this autoimmune disease can have severe impacts on your health in the long haul, but if you’re diagnosed in your early years you can save some health issues by switching over to the gluten free diet.\n\nWhether you have celiac disease or not, you can all benefit from taking on a form of the gluten free diet. This structure will allow you to avoid mass amounts of starchy carbohydrates and processed foods that you probably don’t need to consume in the first place. Gluten is a protein that will be found in a few types of grains such as wheat, rye, barley, and triticale (cross between rye and wheat). So avoiding these types of grains really isn’t that complicated in the big picture. But the majority of us aren’t aware of \"healthy\" products that may be mixed with gluten containing grains, additives, or preservatives.\n\nThe majority of food consumed in America’s diet contains some sort of these gluten filled grains and proves it hard to stray away from. Though most of your previous meals consumed bread, cereals, and grains; you can have a large selection of other types of grains and starches to choose from, these may include:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Amaranth</li>\n\t<li>Arrowroot</li>\n\t<li>Buckwheat</li>\n\t<li>Corn and cornmeal</li>\n\t<li>Flax</li>\n\t<li>Gluten-free flours (rice, soy, corn, potato, bean)</li>\n\t<li>Hominy (corn)</li>\n\t<li>Millet</li>\n\t<li>Quinoa</li>\n\t<li>Rice</li>\n\t<li>Sorghum</li>\n\t<li>Soy</li>\n\t<li>Tapioca</li>\n\t<li>Teff</li>\n</ul>\nIf your goal is to eat a gluten free diet to completely stay away from starchy carbs and grains then there may be a better alternative for you.

Learn what is hidden in your supplements.","Content":"<h2>Warning Signs About Healthy versus Harmful Supplements</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nWith dietary supplements as popular as ever in the health and fitness industry, we are vulnerable to consuming everything labeled with promises and made up statements that guarantee unbelievable results in just one scoop. In reality, you probably have no idea what you are consuming or what it truly does to your body, but hey, getting huge right? It's time to learn what is hidden in your supplements.\n\nHave you ever heard the saying, “if you can’t spell it don’t take it?” Well this is a pretty good guideline to follow when taking many of these mysterious supplements. If you’re looking on the back of the bottle and notice an ingredient list with 46 words that appear to be in some other language, then you’re taking the wrong stuff.\n\nConsuming harsh chemicals and preservatives essentially poisons your body if consumed in large enough amounts. Though you may notice nothing when taking a small dose, the effects can start to take a toll on your body when taken for a long period of time. Many of these supplements actually mention to quit using for a few weeks after you have consumed the whole bottle. A few simple statements to be aware of when taking a product are:\n<ul>\n\t<li>An alternative to (or claiming to have similar effects to) an FDA-approved drug—e.g., “All natural alternative to JKL.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>“Do not take if you have any medical condition, if you are taking any prescription medications, or if you are pregnant.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>“May cause a positive result in a performance-enhancing drug test.”</li>\n</ul>\nSo, when some of these companies sneak into the industry with their false claims and dangerous products, how do you know whom to trust? Well there are now some third-party certification programs that will take supplements and rate their ingredients on quality and purity. Though this isn’t the FDA, it will be your next best option for safety and information about supplements. USP, NSF International, Informed-Choice, and Consumerlab.com are the most trusted, and should be present on all your supplements.\n\nIf you don’t see any of those third-party approval stamps, be aware of a few banned or dangerous ingredients you that you shouldn’t be consuming. A few popular substances that have been known to cause harm to your body when repeatedly taken include:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Ephedra</li>\n\t<li>DMAA (1,3 dimethylamylamine)</li>\n\t<li>Cathine</li>\n\t<li>1-androstenediol</li>\n</ul>\nWith such a large product category and hundreds of options to choose from, finding the right supplement is something that should be taken seriously. It is important to know what you are putting into your body and finding a product with the best ingredients is key for your success. Your body supports you in everything that you do, show it some love and consideration when choosing supplements.

What is happening? Perhaps you have tried topical ointments or creams, antibiotics, or a plethora of other products in an attempt to clear up some skin disorder, they may have worked or not but the temporary solution is just that. Did it start due to your sudden change in diet or increase in exercise? This skin disorder came without warning; you maybe now feel that there must be <strong>something else</strong> as you have tried everything! It is possible that <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-recipes/paleo-and-gluten-intolerance-or-celiac-disease-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Gluten Intolerance</a> or Celiac Disease may be at the root of your skin problems.\n\nDermatitis Herpetiformis (DH) is one such skin ailment that occurs as a result of gluten. It is one of the “itches” that won’t go away without proper treatment. With a proper, simple and pain-free skin test (biopsy) your practitioner or nutritionist can determine if you have the auto-immune disease commonly termed Celiac Disease.\n\nAs a Paleo recipe developer, researcher, writer, health advocate and author, I have a strong interest in issues relating to people of all ages and I like to see people properly informed and properly diagnosed. Anyone can get this skin disorder. Although dermatitis herpetiformis<em> usually</em> occurs for life once it appears, permanent remission is reported to occur in 10-20 percent of patients, usually after long-term adherence to a <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-diet/gluten-free-and-paleo/\" target=\"_blank\">gluten-free diet</a>. I am celiac, I have three kids, two with CD and the one has Dermatitis Herpetiformis (DH).\n\nWhy all of a sudden may an adult get a gluten intolerance or celiac disease? Why are you just now experiencing a gluten intolerance skin rash? There are various reasons it can “turn on” in adulthood or the baby-boomer. One very common reason may be a stressful situation in one’s life. There is also the possibility that it had been there yet it surfaced with symptoms crying out louder now. Being properly diagnosed is the first and proper door to a correct handling, and once any ailment is correctly diagnosed life become much simpler. I was 7 years misdiagnosed and my life, my health and my well-being has been incredible ever since, upwards and thriving!\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-3800 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/club-soda-bread-5-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"grain_gluten intolerance\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />\n\nDH was first described as a distinct clinical entity in 1884 by an American dermatologist, Louis Duhring. But it wasn’t until 1967 that is was actually linked to gluten sensitivity/intolerance. Instead of digesting gluten, the body fights it with an antibody (called IgA) that is produced in the lining of the intestines. When IgA combines with ingested gluten, the combine antibody/gluten substance circulates in the bloodstream and eventually clogs up the small blood vessels in the skin. The clog attracts white blood cells brought in by the body to fight the invasion. The white blood cells, in turn, release powerful chemicals that create the rash. Typically, DH is characterized by small groups of itchy blisters, often on red plaques, located on the back of the elbows and forearms, on the buttocks and in the front of the knees. But, the rash can occur in other places on the body, including the face, scalp, back and trunk.\n\nWith a gluten intolerance or celiac disease the body has a greater inability to properly absorb and distribute nutrients and deficiencies in vitamins and minerals develop. You can do all the diets and exercises in the world and think you are doing the best for your body, but if you have this underlying gluten issue and are eating any gluten you will remain with this internal flare in your body - inflammation. The result will be a remaining rash.\n\nVitamins A and D contribute to healthy skin. Vitamin A is consumed in controlling inflammations, so Celiacs need more Vitamin A to begin with. A case of dry or flaky skin, or chronic split heels could suggest either mal-absorption from undiagnosed gluten intolerance or malnutrition.\n\nA solution to these ailments may be a gluten free diet and even better, the <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/food-lists-meal-plans/paleo-food-list/\" target=\"_blank\">Paleo diet</a>! There are also creams and treatments that will aid in the healing and itching <strong>but the real culprit may be the gluten</strong> and the ailment will not truly go away until the culprit is determined.\n\nI highly suggests if any skin ailment is non-responsive to all you have tried, talk to your practitioner or nutritionist about testing for gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Your world can change with the <strong>proper</strong> diagnosis and treatment. For more information <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">email me</a>. I welcome your feedback and questions always.\n\nI have worked in this field and with many groups, professionals, research scientists, universities, authors and organizations for many years. I am a celiac, one who has worked as an advocate to increase awareness of gluten intolerance skin rash issues and one who made the change from the standard “gluten-free” diet to Paleo.

It's even harder to say no when these relatives then say, \"Come on, just try a bite!\" \"One day won't make a difference!' Or my favorite one: \"I made this just for you!\" It can be so hard to not only overcome the temptation of the food itself, but the temptation to just say yes for fear of offending your family or friends. If your family is like mine, declining food is akin to rejecting your mom's love.\n\n[Tweet \"If your family is like mine, declining food is akin to rejecting your mom's love.\"]\n\nBy now, I have come up with a bag of tricks to skirt around such awkward confrontations. If you're choosing to stay on your healthy course throughout this holiday season, here are a few tips on how to say no to unhealthy food without being harsh.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>1. Practice a polite exit strategy. </strong>I like to practice exactly what I'm going to say when someone offers me food before I even step foot into the event. It's important to make the conversation about <em>your goals </em>and <em>your plan</em>, without making it seem like you're not eating <em>their food </em>because it's not the best healthy option. Saying something like, \"That looks delicious, but I'm limiting my plate to three choices today\" doesn't insinuate that their dish doesn't look good or you don't want to try their food or that it isn't healthy enough; you're just giving yourself a limit. By keeping the conversation focused on you, you will avoid upsetting anyone.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>2. Put it on your plate, and leave it there. </strong>This may be too tempting to some people, but if you are in a situation where uncle Steve just <em>won't let you leave without trying his baked beans</em>, just put some on your plate and walk away. Later, when he's out of sight, either throw it away or give it to someone else. Sometimes you just have to fake it in order to save face, and although I'm a firm advocate of honesty, honesty may not be the best policy here.\n\n[Tweet \"Pro tip: Don't want to offend foodies? Put it on your plate, and leave it there.\"]\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>3. Bring your own dish and pile it on your plate. </strong>Bringing your own plan-friendly foods not only makes it easier for you to stay on track, but it can also serve as a buffer between you and pushy party-goers. Pile a large portion of your dish on a small plate so that way when you are asked to sample another dish, you can say that you may try it later but already have a lot of food on your plate at the moment.\n\n[Tweet \"Bring your own paleo-friendly foods makes it easier for you to stay on track and buffer between you and pushy party-goers. \"]\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>4. When all else fails, fake it until you make it. </strong>Again, lying is never something I recommend, but telling a fib may be the only way to nip nagging questions in the bud. Tell them that you already tried it, and it was delicious/good/great/etc. Sometimes desperate times call for desperate measures, even if it requires you to tell a small \"untruth.\"\n\n[Tweet \"When all else fails, fake it until you make it. \"]\n\n<hr />\n\nIt's extremely difficult to be on-plan during the holidays, especially if there are people in your life that may not be supportive or understand your goals. Be aware that they most likely mean well, it's just human nature to want to feed everyone and be a caretaker and good host or hostess. Hopefully by utilizing these tips to decline unhealthy food, you can avoid any miscommunication or hurt feelings and be able to enjoy the season for what it is all about: being around those you love, and cherishing timeless traditions.","Slug":"tips-to-decline-unhealthy-food","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/lifestyle_design/tips-to-decline-unhealthy-food/","Path":"/lifestyle_design/tips-to-decline-unhealthy-food/","Date":"2014-12-02","Year":"2014","Month":"12","Day":"02","Categories":"Lifestyle Design","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/dinner_with_friends.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/healthy-holiday-party-tips.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/dinner_with_friends.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/healthy-holiday-party-tips.jpg","Image Alt Text":"dinner_with_friends | healthy holiday party tips"},{"id":"3914","Title":"How to Combat Your Stress and Anxiety","Meta Description":"Don't let stress or anxiety effect your health and performance goals.

We're not quite sure where the recipe originated, but we <em>think</em> it was clipped from a magazine by my favorite aunt: Aunt Polly. (She almost always wore a stylish hat and knew her way around a snappy comeback.) My glamorous, somewhat eccentric aunt gave my mom the scrap of paper from a ladies' magazine and the recipe made it into our permanent holiday rotation. We always ate this \"salad\" along with our dinner, even though it's more like a dessert. The original recipe included a 1/2 cup of white sugar, a bag of mini marshmallows, and a whole container of Cool-Whip!\n\nThis version gets its sweetness from apples, grapes, and dried apricots. The fruit is wrapped up in a fluffy cloud of whipped coconut milk. It's a mixture of flavors and textures that, to me, tastes like family and fun. Happy  holidays!\n\n<strong>Paleo Cranberry Waldorf Salad</strong>\n<em>Makes enough for a party!</em>\n\n<strong>Ingredients:</strong>\n1 can full-fat coconut milk (Thai Kitchen works great!)\n12 ounces fresh cranberries\n16 dried apricots\n1 pound seedless grapes, cut in half\n2 medium apples, cut into bite-sized pieces\n1/2 cup pecan halves\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n\n<strong> Directions:</strong>\n<strong>**This requires a bit of preparation:</strong> Place a can of coconut milk in the refrigerator, ideally overnight, but 3-4 hours will do. Also, this salad works best if you do the prep, let it sit overnight, then assemble shortly before eating.\n\n<strong>Prep\n</strong>1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Put a mixing bowl and beater from an electric mixer in the freezer.\n\n2. Wash the cranberries and set a few aside for garnish. Place the rest in the bowl of a food processor with the dried apricots and grind them until the mixture has the consistency of relish. (Go ahead… sneak a little bite. It’s tangy and delicious!)\n\n3. In a large bowl, toss the cranberry-apricot relish with the cut apples and grapes. Cover tightly and place in the refrigerator so they can get to know each other. Forget about them until the next day.\n\n4. Meanwhile, spread the pecans on a baking sheet in a single layer and toast for 5-7 minutes until golden. Keep an eye on them; they can burn quickly. When they’re cool, chop the pecans and set aside – be sure to save a few unchopped for garnish. Resist the urge to eat them immediately. If you’re feeling lazy, you can use untoasted pecans; it will be fine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cranberrywaldorf.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3943\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cranberrywaldorf-300x214.jpg\" alt=\"cranberrywaldorf\" width=\"300\" height=\"214\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Assembly</strong>\n1. When you’re ready to assemble the salad, take your can of coconut milk out of the fridge — don’t shake it. Remove the mixing bowl and beater from the freezer. Turn the can of coconut milk upside down, open with a can opener, and pour off the liquid. Now scoop the thick, coconut cream into the chilled mixing bowl. Add the vanilla extract and beat the mixture on the highest speed of your mixer until it looks like whipped cream. This takes about 5-7 minutes.\n\n2. When the whipped cream is done, place the chopped pecans and fruit relish in a large bowl. Gently fold in the whipped cream and garnish with whole cranberries and nuts.","Slug":"paleo-cranberry-waldorf-salad","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/healthy_recipes/paleo-cranberry-waldorf-salad/","Path":"/healthy_recipes/paleo-cranberry-waldorf-salad/","Date":"2014-12-23","Year":"2014","Month":"12","Day":"23","Categories":"Paleo Recipes","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/paleo-cranberry-waldorf-salad.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cranberrywaldorf.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/paleo-cranberry-waldorf-salad.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cranberrywaldorf.jpg","Image Alt Text":" | "},{"id":"3944","Title":"Cinnamon Beef Stew","Content":"&nbsp;\n\nA warm, comforting stew is almost always a good idea. And one of the great pleasures of eating a hearty stew is that while it simmers, you can <em>almost</em> forget you were the one who made it. Then, when it’s time to sit down and eat, it feels as if someone else cooked for you. What a treat!\n\nIn this flavorful stew, the cinnamon and herbs create a mellow, earthy gravy. It’s sophisticated comfort food that's equally good for lunch, dinner, or even breakfast, with a nice fried egg on top.\n\nLike all great stews, this one improves with age. It tastes even better on day 2 and 3 (and 4),  and it freezes/defrosts beautifully.\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3945\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/beefstew-300x243.jpg\" alt=\"cinnamon beef stew\" width=\"300\" height=\"243\" /></strong>\n\n<strong>Cinnamon Beef Stew</strong>\n<em>Serves 6-10 | Prep 30 minutes | Cook about 90 minutes</em>\n\n<strong>Ingredients:</strong>\n2-3 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes\nsalt and black pepper\n3 tablespoons coconut oil (or your favorite cooking fat)\n1 medium carrot, peeled and finely chopped (about 1/4 cup)\n1 medium onion, diced (about 1 cup)\n1 medium celery stalk, finely chopped (about 1/4 cup)\n2 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n1/2 cup beef broth\n2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar\n3-5 cups water\n2 teaspoons salt\n1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 bay leaves\n1 sprig fresh rosemary (or 1/2 teaspoon dried)\n1 sprig fresh thyme (or 1/2 teaspoon dried)\n1 sprig fresh sage (or 1/2 teaspoon dried)\n2 cinnamon sticks\nextra-virgin olive oil, for garnish (optional)\n\n<strong> Directions:</strong>\n1. Sprinkle the beef generously with salt and pepper. In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the coconut oil over medium-high heat, then add the meat in batches and sear on all sides. It’s important that you don’t crowd the pan. The meat needs air around it to achieve a crisp brown crust. With tongs or a slotted spoon, remove the browned pieces to a bowl to catch their juice. Repeat with the remaining cubes.\n\n2. In the same pot, sauté the chopped carrot, onion, celery, and garlic for about 2 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon. Add the tomato paste and stir for about 1 minute.\n\n3. Add the broth and vinegar, then stir with passion, scraping up all the wonderful brown bits at the bottom of the pan. Keep stirring until the mixture starts to thicken.\n\n4. Put the meat and its drippings back into the pot. Add 3 cups water, 2 teaspoons salt, a healthy dose of pepper, the bay leaves, rosemary, thyme, sage, and cinnamon sticks.\n\n5. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer with the pot only partially covered for about 90 minutes. This is not a soupy stew, but if the stew starts to dry out, add more water, about a 1/2 cup at a time. Simmer until the meat is fall-apart tender and the liquid in the pan has been reduced to gravy-like status.\n\n6. Remove the cinnamon sticks and herb stems from the stew pot. Ladle the stew into deep bowls — bonus points if you also add a light drizzle of olive oil.","Slug":"cinnamon-beef-stew","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/healthy_recipes/cinnamon-beef-stew/","Path":"/healthy_recipes/cinnamon-beef-stew/","Date":"2014-12-09","Year":"2014","Month":"12","Day":"09","Categories":"Paleo Recipes","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/beefstew.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/beefstew.jpg","Image Alt Text":"cinnamon beef stew"},{"id":"3947","Title":"Paleo Savory Granola","Meta Description":"There is not enough holiday magic on the planet to get me to eat Chex again.

You may not be going to the CrossFit Games or running the Leadville Ultramarathon, but you can obtain the same level of physical performance with the right mental training. From my experience as a certified trainer in the CrossFit space, here is key pieces of advice to unfold your fitness potential.\n\nIn extreme fitness sports, it is important that you know how to get yourself fired up, and how to calm yourself down. Between workouts or events in a competition, you will want to get relaxed and stay calm. When something goes wrong in a WOD, or you miss a rep, you may need to chill out to make sure you don’t waste useful energy. There are other times during your workouts, or before them, that you'll want to get pumped up, and increase your energy. Before a max effort lift, or when you need to use high intensity, you'll likely want to get more fired up.\n\nFind what works best for you, so that you know what amount of arousal will help you perform your best\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Ways To Get Calm</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Practice taking deep breaths</li>\n\t<li>Use  relaxing visualizations</li>\n\t<li>Listen to calming music</li>\n\t<li>Relax your muscles</li>\n\t<li>Reminding yourself what you can control</li>\n\t<li>Think about comforting thoughts (people, memories, prayers)</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Ways To Get Fired Up</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Listen to fast music</li>\n\t<li>Take quicker breaths</li>\n\t<li>Clapping</li>\n\t<li>Jump around, stomp or do quick motions with your body</li>\n\t<li>Think about something that gets you pumped, angry or excited</li>\n\t<li>Yell</li>\n\t<li>Use visualizations that get you going</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nRealize that you're in control of your <a href=\"http://mentalitywod.com/6250/3-things-to-let-go-of-243/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>thoughts</strong></a> and your <a href=\"http://mentalitywod.com/4317/your-body-language-speaks-loudly29/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>body language</strong></a>, and you can get them both to work for you to help you feel the right amount of arousal.

Have you been wondering what others include in their journals? Have you never used a journal to track and record anything? I'm here to give you practical training journal tips. Read more...\n\nThere really is no right or wrong way to use a training journal. Still, the psychology of our mind has a proven record of better performance when we record our fitness and diet activities. It helps our mind internalize what we have done and track goals that we aspire to achieve. The first takeaway here is write your training down.\n\nI suggest that you take some pre-workout notes and post-workout notes for at least 30 days, to see what you can learn about yourself. If you’ve never done it, keep it simple and stick to the basics. If you're a more seasoned athlete then you may want to record even more details, so that you can fine-tune your performance and improve on every level. Try setting journal habits that are simple, then build on them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere are some different types of journaling I suggest:\n\n<strong>Very Minimal Info:</strong>  the date, what you did, and (possibly) bullet points on how you felt.\n\n<strong>Some More Info:</strong> the date, where you were, what you did, how your energy and mood were before the WOD, a couple of positive points from the workout, a couple of things you’d like to improve on from the workout.\n\n<strong>Lots of Info:</strong> Some people just love information and prefer to take very detailed notes. Here’s a list of info you could add – time of training, what you did, results, rate of effort during training, highlight of training session, any muscle soreness or pain, nutrition (pre/post workout), quality of sleep the night before training, energy levels before and after training, level of stress, level of confidence, level of motivation, any negative thoughts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI typically suggest something similar to the middle option, as it’s important to get used to tuning into how you feel before the workout, as well as after it. I like to help athletes asses their physical and mental condition, so that they have a better understanding that it’s all connected.

Fortunately there's a treatment.","Content":"<h2>How to Ensure Favorable Response to a Gluten Free Diet</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nFor most celiac patients, treatment on the gluten-free diet marks the turning point for their health. It can take a few months for the villi of the small intestine to heal, but eventually their symptoms are alleviated and they are able to absorb the nutrients in their food. Unfortunately, there is a percentage of celiacs who don’t respond to the gluten-free diet, which is the only current treatment for the disease, resulting in a condition known as <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-recipes/paleo-advocate-my-life-before/\">refractory celiac disease</a>, also known as nonresponsive celiac disease (NRCD). Although celiac experts have stated that actual refractory celiac disease, whereby damage to the small intestine is irrevocable, is rare, a preliminary study reported by <em>Med Page Today</em> suggests that the condition is more common than the medical community once thought. Fortunately, the study also showed that refractory CD patients did respond favorably to medical treatment.\n\nCeliac disease, an autoimmune disease caused by <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/faq/\">gluten</a>, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, affects three million Americans, or 1% of the U.S. population. Patients with refractory celiac disease experience abdominal pain, severe malabsorption of nutrients, and intestinal damage. A single-center preliminary study suggests that “more patients with celiac disease may stop responding to their gluten-free diets,” as reported by <em>Med Page Today</em>.\n\nThe researchers studied nonresponsive celiac patients treated at the University of Virginia Medical Center over the past decade. According to <em>Med Page Today</em>, “Overall, patients were diagnosed with refractive disease a mean of 4.7 years following their initial diagnosis of celiac disease.” Furthermore, refractive celiac diagnoses seemed to occur more recently, mostly within the last five years and almost half of them within the last six months. The researchers, which include Christopher Hammerle, MD, and Sheila Crowe, MD, of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, found that the refractory celiac disease patients did end up responding to treatment with thiopurines.\n\n\"These agents are my treatment-of-choice for refractory celiac disease to avoid long-term steroids,\" Hammerle told <em>MedPage Today.</em>\n\nAccording to Shailaja Jamma, MD, and <strong>Daniel Leffler</strong>, MD, MS, in <em>Real Life with Celiac Disease</em>, there could be many explanations for a failure to respond favorably to the <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-diet/gluten-free-and-paleo/\">gluten-free diet</a>. In their chapter on NRCD, they write, “you would need to be on a GFD for at least 6 months without significant improvement before we would decide that you were not responding and look for other reasons.” This is due to the fact that recovery times vary from person to person, and as long as a patient seems to be improving continually over time, no matter the speed, nonresponsive celiac disease is usually an unnecessary label.\n\nJamma and Leffler found that the most common causes—designated “very common”—are gluten exposure and <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-recipes/paleo-sibo-diet-saves-a-womans-life/\">Irritable Bowel Syndrome</a> (IBS). The next most common causes of NRCD, labeled as “somewhat common,” are lactose intolerance or fructose malabsorption, microscopic colitis, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. “Rare” causes include actual refractory celiac disease, which can be confirmed with a biopsy of the small intestine, an eating disorder, inflammatory bowel disease, which can also be confirmed with a biopsy as well as imaging studies of the small or large intestine, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and motility disturbances, that is, when food moves too fast or too slow through the intestine. Finally, a food allergy and cancer are “very rare” causes of NCRD.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, as reported by Celiac.com, “gluten contamination is the leading reason for non-responsive celiac disease,” and estimates that 18% of non-responsive celiac disease cases are due to actual refractory celiac disease. The Mayo Clinic researchers recommend that before making a refractory celiac disease diagnosis, additional diseases as well as gluten contamination should be eliminated as causes. Acccording to Jamma and Leffler, “The first step is often to get confirmation that you do indeed have celiac disease,” since “celiac disease can be mistakenly diagnosed when the true problem is something else.”\n\n<em>Med Page Today</em> points out that most of the patients with refractory celiac disease responded favorably to a thiopurine medication rather than the conventional method of treatment for the condition, steroids.

Once you become dependant on alcohol or drugs it seems impossible to quit your daily fix that gives you some sort of temporary relief. It starts innocently enough with a couple of drinks with friends and before you know it, you are drinking almost every other day! Let us find out how <strong>CrossFit</strong> acted as a catalyst in fashioning an alcoholic into a changed individual.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>Who is Adam Huston?</strong></h3>\nNo he isn’t a celebrity or someone famous- he is an ordinary guy who became addicted to drinking like thousands of others worldwide. He was just like any other person, looking for a good time with his friends. Before long, he was drinking all the time regardless of the occasion. Getting arrested for drinking and driving had become a common occurrence for him. However, he realized that he was basically throwing his life away, especially since a couple of his family members have a bad history when it comes to drinking. He didn’t want to check into a rehab to combat his addiction – he chose a different way to deal with it. <strong>CrossFit </strong>was the perfect answer to his problems.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>How CrossFit helped him?</strong></h3>\nEnrolling in <strong>CrossFit</strong> completely changed his outlook on life and made him into a stronger and more confident person. He lost almost 23 pounds and even though the grueling routines were tough at first, he slowly began to get the hang of it. The turning point is when he came to terms with the fact that drinking wasn’t the right way to channel his emotions as it would hamper his health. The beauty of <strong>CrossFit</strong> is that the exercises are not just devised to target physical fitness but also ensure peace of mind at the same time. You learn to sharpen focus on life and work, be more alert, and don’t let stress bring you down. It allowed Adam to emerge from what he calls his “dark place” as a person who is ready to take on life as it comes.

The usefulness of this frothy beverage was brought to the forefront by Andy Jones, one of the main researchers about the effects of beet juice.  To read his full analysis, <a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/10/27/beet-juice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here</a>, or get the abbreviated key points of his research.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>How does beet juice work?</h3>\nThe nitrate content is extremely high in the juice. The body changes the nitrate to nitrite, eventually forming nitric oxide. For an athlete, it goes a long way in boosting their performance due to these reasons:\n\n·       The blood vessels widen, thus increasing the flow of blood through them.\n\n·       The functionality of mitochondria is enhanced, so they can produce more energy by using up less oxygen. The extra oxygen will be useful during the performance.\n\nWe are generally advised to steer clear from nitrates and nitrites as the might bond with meat proteins, resulting in carcinogenic compounds that are harmful, but Jones has clearly proved that understanding how nitrates and nitrites work is still in its nascent stage. Since beet juice has nitrate in it, the protein is missing that assists in forming carcinogenic elements. However, it should be consumed in moderation or else there are chances of gastric issues.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>What are the results of the research?</h3>\nJones’s study comprised of 8 cyclists over a 50-mile cycling time trial. When they reported their findings in the first phase, they came to the conclusion that there wasn’t any significant improvement in cyclists. The data showed that the improvement in the case of each rider doing two-time trials – after drinking half a liter of normal juice, and then consuming half a liter of juice without nitrates. The improvement was just 0.8%, which isn’t that great in terms of statistical importance.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Jones refutes the statement by saying that a 0.8% improvement could be beneficial during an event. Another strange occurrence was that five of the cyclists experience an increase in their level of plasma nitrite while the other three showed a decrease. The research showed that beet juice had a greater ergogenic effect on regular athletes than in the case of elite <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJ6V0FC/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=amrapwebsite-20&amp;linkId=2ROBJKQFJQHUULSA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-5684 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Beet-nitrates2-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>performers.

In fact, there have been several programs launched to implement bans on products that contain GMOs. For instance, you can spot critics around the farmers market urging people to buy GMO free products only. Learn what to know about GMOs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What are GMOs?</strong>\n\nThe term GMO indicates genetically modified organisms, whose genetic structure or DNA had been changed artificially in a laboratory with the aid of genetic engineering techniques. This scientific method was developed in order to conceptualize combinations of plant, bacteria, viral, and animal genes that don’t occur naturally or via traditional crossbreeding. Needless to say, this combination is unstable.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What is the risk?</strong>\n\nIn most countries, GMOs are considered to be harmful, which is why there have been restrictions or complete bans on production and sale of products with GMOs in them. Individuals have become more conscious so they wish to know if they are consuming food with GMOs in them, but the labels might not contain accurate information in this case. In 2012, a poll by the Mellman Group clearly stated that 91% of American consumers wanted to know via labels about the presence of GMOs. Some even went on to say that they would switch diets if they discovered that the food chain has been tampered with. Long term effects of such products on the human body are still not known.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What is the Non-GMO Project?</strong>\n\nIt is a non-profit organization that is dedicated towards providing consumers with an informed choice and also protecting the non-GMO food products. Their objective is to educate people so that they stop buying GMO laden foods from the markets, which in turn will force the companies from marketing them and farmers from producing them at all. The Non-GMO Project’s seal for verified products will be a 100% guarantee that there is no GMO.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What remains to be done?</strong>\n\nIn spite of organizations working hard to make people aware about GMOs, most individuals shopping at farmers markets or department stores don’t even know what those initials stand for, let alone being informed about the harm they cause. Before any kind of change is made, it is necessary to ensure that the majority of the American population knows about the problem, after which they can work towards implementing the solution.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow you know how important it is to eat right, take a look at these <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/shop/\">nutrition bars</a> from AMRAP that are available in a variety of gluten-free and non-gmo yummy flavors.

It takes a lot of strength and courage to face the fact that one has cancer and make an effort to fight it instead of breaking down. However, it is possible to get back on your feet with the right kind of <strong>fitness regimen</strong>.\n\nHere is the story of a 73-year old CrossFitter, prostate cancer survivor, and overall inspirational athlete. From the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeLVMgz-yUo&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>, this is what you'll takeaway from the story.\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>Bravery comes from within</strong></h3>\nJacinto Bonilla is a role model for us as he is a brave survivor of prostrate cancer but throughout the entire ordeal he has remained true to his commitment to bodybuilding. He was always into exercising and fitness, so when he discovered CrossFit Virtuosity in Brooklyn, it was too good of an opportunity for him to pass up. He is a force to reckon with – when he learned that he had been diagnosed with cancer he didn’t fold inward and question, “Why me”; on the contrary he asked the doctor how he could fight it. That shows the mental strength he possesses and the years he spent indulging in exercises helped to hone his mind in that way.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe was used to heavy weights and other rigorous exercises, but was in for a surprise when he came into CrossFit for the first time. Keith Wittenstein, the head coach at CrossFit Virtuosity in Bonilla’s own words – “Busted him”. However, this didn’t deter Bonilla in the least, and he kept coming back to master all exercises in his <strong>fitness regimen</strong>. Even his cancer failed to dampen his enthusiasm towards CrossFit. He had hernia after he returned to heavy exercising post his cancer operation, but he managed to bounce back with zest.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>Age doesn’t matter!</strong></h3>\nThe Filthy Fifty workout was developed as a set of ten exercises, each of which had to be done 50 times. Bonilla modified the regimen on his 68<sup>th</sup> birthday by challenging everyone to perform six of those exercises 68 times. With each birthday, he increases the total count by 1. The workout, consisting of squats, pushups, and wall balls is now known as “Jacinto Storm” in his honor. He keeps on testing his limits and records his scores to check if he fared better than the previous year. Bonilla at his age is proud that he is in great shape to beat younger men with far more stamina and gumption. He motivates youngsters to stick to their fitness regimen by saying if he can do it, so can they!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThus you can see how CrossFit is beneficial for people of all ages.

But <a href=\"http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/magazine/why-are-americans-so-fascinated-with-extreme-fitness.html?referrer=&amp;_r=2\" target=\"_blank\">an article</a> in the New York Times by <em>New York Times Magazine</em> contributor and Bookforum columnist Heather Havrilesky, has severely criticized <strong>functional fitness</strong> routines such as CrossFit, by stating that it causes bodily injuries, is unnecessarily tough, and is very boring. Here is our honest reasoning as to why CrossFit or ultra running hold merit and benefit our society. This is an argument for why extreme fitness is a good thing for Americans.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>Let us journey back…</strong></h3>\nIt is worth a mention that CrossFit has been designated as fitness fad that is in no way related to health and fitness. Havrilesky goes way back to the 1960s or more precisely the era when people began to switch to less active jobs as compared to labor intensive ones. As the years went by, more people started to purchase automobiles, lifts were introduced, and individuals began spending more time in front of the television. Fitness was no longer a priority – it became an option. The only form of exercise practiced frequently was jogging.\n\nMoving to the ’70s and ’80s, Havrilesky credits Jane Fonda and Richard Simmons as the pioneers behind the mindset of associating exercises with fun and enjoyment. According to her, even the ‘90s were way better in terms of fitness because people took some interest in getting great looking bodies. But CrossFit, as a mode of <strong>functional fitness</strong>, is apparently not helping in any way – on the contrary it is preparing the bed for a disaster that is unknown and unpredictable, which is a passive-aggressive dig at the mission statement of CrossFit.\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Why reviewers are off the mark</h3>\nThe major benefit of <strong>functional fitness</strong> has been given a total miss, which drives people to follow a workout routine and stick to it. This so-called fad has achieved a great success rate with little investment in terms of money and has worked wonders in motivating thousands all over the world. Researchers have come up with evidence that CrossFit targets both physical and mental health and strives for all round development. Even the portion of the article that talks about injuries due to this extreme and rigorous form of fitness is supported by little proof and vague results.\n\nCriticizing CrossFit can be equated to taking a shot in the dark based on guess-timates.

You have to be patient and dedicatedly go for workouts. Although you don’t have to starve, you definitely need to cut down on some of your favorite foods due to the unhealthy fat content being excessively high in them. Losing weight is not a trend or fad anymore – it has become a necessity in order to achieve all round fitness.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of myths and misconceptions circulating, which can steer you in the wrong direction. Take a look at these classic <strong>weight loss</strong> pitfalls and five weight loss pointers to remember:\n<ul>\n\t<li>As stated before, any change takes a certain amount of time, so drastically cutting down on your food intake will not help in any way. It has taken you a while to build up habits such as gorging on pizza twice a week, so it will take some time before you can modify it. Start slow and build up the pace towards a healthier lifestyle as you go along. Give your body sufficient time to adjust.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Even if you end up buying products that claim to be gluten-free, farm-raised, sugar-free, organic, or fat-free, they still contain calories. The trick to shedding excess fat is to ensure you burn more calories than you eat. Don’t get taken in by fancy words – do a bit of calculation before eating anything. Or better, turn to nutrient-rich whole foods that don't demand counting calories.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Skipping breakfast is one of the most common myths when it comes to <strong>weight loss</strong>. You will often come across people proudly proclaiming that they don’t eat breakfast in order to lose weight. This leads to a reverse reaction – skipping breakfast, which is your first meal of the day, increase your hunger pangs causing you to eat much more at lunch and dinner.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Trans and excess saturated fats can lead to heart diseases and boost your bad cholesterol. That doesn’t all fats are harmful or they contribute to weight gain. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats help to reduce heart-related risks and prevents the bad cholesterol levels from going up. Fat is needed for your body to function, so you need to consume it in moderation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>You should steer clear from artificial sweeteners as they cause major gastrointestinal problems and increase the risk of diabetes. Zero-calorie colas also contain artificial sweeteners, which don’t aid in <strong>weight loss</strong> in any way. Substitute sodas and colas for green tea and water.</li>\n</ul>\nAlways remember that <strong>weight loss</strong> routines are a combination of eating balanced meals along with regular exercising.

The small amount of pain doesn’t necessarily mean you have <strong>rhabdo</strong>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>2. What is the main cause?</strong></h3>\nWhen you keep repeating the same movement for a long time without changing routines or resting in between, the muscles experience a lot of strain. It also happens when light loads are used continuously in long workouts. Contrary to common misconception, heavy lifting doesn’t contribute to <strong>rhabdo</strong> in any way – in fact it forcibly brings the body to a stop before the muscles start to break down. Individuals are more likely to get <strong>rhabdo</strong> if they have been away from high intensity routines for some time, and they suddenly start working out with increased vigor and energy. If you have been out of commission for a while, it is important that you take it slow, thus allowing your body to adjust before returning full-fledged to your earlier workouts.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>3. Can CrossFit workouts be performed despite the risk?</strong></h3>\nAt CrossFit centers, your health is their top priority and is taken very seriously. Each program they have developed has been structured in such a way that the possibility of <strong>rhabdo</strong> occurring is minimized. There are mechanisms in place that help to identify individuals who are at risk and prevent <strong>rhabdo</strong> before the routine commences. Coaches here are trained to scale workouts and fit them as per your abilities – you will be provided with different scaled versions, and they will help you choose the one that is best suited for you. Cutoff times are incorporated in the high intensity routines, so that muscles are not over-stressed and there is sufficient time for recovery. If there is even the slightest risk, the workout will be stopped immediately.\n\nCrossFit is fascinating right?

It has been known to mess with the functionality of the brain.</li>\n\t<li>Andy Briscoe, the president of the Sugar Association has stated that sugar doesn’t have any bearing on diabetes or obesity – a fact that is completely untrue. While sugar might not be the only ingredient responsible for those conditions, it certainly contributes to them. Scientists are openly claiming that sugar and obesity are unrelated, but that is mostly because they are on the payroll of some top honchos in the industry and don’t want to lose their retainers!</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What is FDA doing?</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOliver says that while the effects of sugar might still be debatable, consumers have a right to know when it is being added to their food. We couldn’t agree more. Food should be transparent. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed changes to nutrition labels by mentioning “added sugars” as a separate category, but have been bombarded with letters from every conceivable product in the food industry. If the changes were to take place, it would be extremely beneficial to consumers as they would know exactly how much sugar is in the product. Trouble is they are not likely to go through with it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe American Beverage Association wrote to the FDA that if there is an “added sugars” category, the quantity should be mentioned in grams and not in teaspoons. Although the association claims that a measurement in teaspoons will confuse people, it is indeed an underhanded attempt to divert consumers from understanding whether the quantity of sugar in the product will be detrimental to their health.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn a funny note, Oliver claims that the sugar content should be listed in terms of circus peanuts, which taste absolutely horrible!

Here is the thing--regardless of what others say, leading a gluten-free life makes you healthier. A lot of people who have experienced digestive troubles, immune problems, or suffered from exhaustion and fatigue have managed to turn their lives around after successfully cutting processed grains and gluten-related foods from their dietary routine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow being gluten-free doesn’t mean cutting down your food intake for that matter because you can’t skimp on nutrition under any circumstances. Unfortunately, many well-intentioned people use the gluten free path wrong. Take a look at these common blunders made by those following a gluten-free diet, so you can avoid them:\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>The good news is that there are loads of gluten-free products in the market and several items are being introduced as well. You can stick to a regular eating pattern due to these foods, but most of these lack basic nutritional value as they are filled with refined flours and sugars.

There are several yummy veggie recipes out there – get creative and whip up something if you are bored of eating vegetables in the same ol’ way!</li>\n\t<li>Beans, nuts, seeds and gluten free pseudograins like buckwheat contain fiber that regulates the blood sugar level, act as a source of nutrition to the beneficial bacteria living in your colon, and tones the digestive tract as well. Going gluten-free can compromise your fiber intake, so don’t let it happen as it has numerous health-related advantages such as reducing chances of chronic diseases and producing more energy.</li>\n\t<li>Having a sweet tooth is a problem for sure. When we switch to a gluten-free diet, we might have something with added sugars that can increase digestive problems and cause inflammation. When you crave for something sweet, opt for a whole fruit, raw date truffles, or frozen grapes.</li>\n\t<li>While it is good to eliminate gluten-laden items from your diet, you shouldn’t forget to replace it with an item that has the same nutritional value or your health can get seriously affected.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nUnnecessary restrictions on your health will always have a reverse effect so stay away from them.

Social psychologist Emily Balcetis talks about how to reach a solution by altering your vision.","Content":"<h2>Breeze through Your Workout Routine by Altering Your Vision</h2>\n<h2></h2>\nHow many times have we seen someone with a killer body and wished the same for ourselves? Have you wondered why you are having a difficult time shedding those extra pounds while others have it easy? Turns out, there is a substantial answer to your question, why exercise is harder for some people? Social psychologist Emily Balcetis talks about how you can reach a solution by changing your entire perspective.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Perception varies</strong>\n\nEveryone perceives the world differently – each person has a varied outlook and vision on life around us. Emily conducted a study where she showed person’s photograph and asked people to identify the emotion on his face. There were more than 120 people who participated in the survey and when the results were tabulated, it clear proved that one person’s notion differs vastly from another. Although the same photograph was circulated among these individuals, each of them noticed something different. It is a classic case of the glass being half full or half empty!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>How do we perceive?</strong>\n\nWhenever we are given a certain amount of information, our mind processes it instantly, but the accuracy rate is quite low. In order to understand what has been provided to you, the mind fills in the blank spots, which makes perception extremely subjective. It was speculated that strongly motivated individuals tend to see their desired goal closer than those who aren’t that motivated. If there is lack of motivation, people are not likely to put an effort into exercising because according to them, they have already achieved their fitness goals.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Why does changing the vision help?</strong>\n\nThis is what conceptualized vision science and led to the strategy known as Keep your eyes on the prize.\" The idea is to tailor the minds of individuals so that they focus solely on what they want to achieve without being distracted. They were trained to ignore everything going on in the sidelines and to blur it out. People, who kept their eyes on the ultimate objective, saw the finish line as 30% closer than others who got distracted. So once you learn to actually concentrate, you will notice a marked improvement in your performance while exercising. You are likely to tire less easily and retain energy for a longer period of time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nKeeping the eyes on the prize teaches you to view the world from a more focused standpoint that works wonders when you try to lose weight. You will automatically start to work out harder and faster without realizing it consciously and that is exactly how you can burn those calories and not feel exhausted and drained.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLearn more about fitness psychology to empower your health potential!  First, Join the <a href=\"http://pages.amrapnutrition.com/subscribe/\" target=\"_blank\">AMRAP Newsletter</a> for more fresh info.

Learn to Set Future-Focused Fitness Goals versus Haphazard Daily Exercise.","Content":"<h2>Learn to Set Future-Focused Fitness Goals v. Haphazard Daily Exercise</h2>\n<h2></h2>\nWe want to be fit and have a toned body, but we don’t know how to go about it. The problem is we tend to follow any and every fitness trend that strikes and elevate it to cult status. As the hullabaloo dies down, we switch to something different. Most of us aren’t really athletes, which is why we face this issue of cult-like exercise programs. The key to overcoming fads is addressed by Mark Rippletoe.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Who is Mark Rippletoe?</h4>\n<a href=\"http://www.outsideonline.com/fitness/bodywork/the-fit-list/Why-Most-Workout-Programs-are-Scams.html\" target=\"_blank\">Coach Mark Rippletoe </a>makes a bold statement by claiming that the fitness industry, whose value is estimated at a whopping $27 billion, is actually out to con you and divest you of a neat sum. Its a controversial topic, and one could even argue hypocritical given his next moves.  Rippletoe owns the Wichita Falls Athletic Club in Texas and has over three decades of experience in grooming weight lifters along with their coaches. He achieved maverick status when he became the first coach to give up his National Strength and Conditioning Association credential; right after parting ways with CrossFit, he developed their barbell program.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Where do we go wrong?</h4>\nHis message is simple – fitness is nothing without strength. This is the only reason he left CrossFit, because he felt that most exercise programs were being designed so they would be perceived as a fad without actually helping anyone to become an athlete. They mix up training and exercise. Getting stronger is not rocket science – it can be easily done with squats, presses, dead lifts, bench presses, and power cleans. These moves help to build muscle by enabling the body to move anatomically. That is the part that a number of CrossFit gyms forget about, despite (sincere) attempts to offer powerful training methodology to aspiring (lifestyle) athletes.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>What is the difference between training and exercise?</h4>\nAccording to Rippletoe, exercises are performed for the results produced today while training is for the long run. The latter is for acquiring physical adaptations for a goal set in the future. For example, consider a jogger who goes for his rounds on a daily basis compared to someone training to run a 5K. The jogger is focused on maintaining good health while the 5K potential runner is focused on giving his best performance on D-Day. Training is a process that has to be mapped out and planned because it requires precision.\n\nKnowing the difference is important, so we know what we should do and how to prevent being caught up in a money-wasting fad and risking an injury. Think about what you want to do and then reach a decision. It is your hard-earned money so it should be spent wisely and get you the desired results. Be sure your gym and your trainers are helping you achieve your health and fitness goals.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you liked this article, subscribe to the <a href=\"http://pages.amrapnutrition.com/subscribe/\" target=\"_blank\">AMRAP Newsletter</a> for more fresh content and exclusive deals, or<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\"> read more</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;","Slug":"know-key-difference-training-exercise","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/everything_crossfit/know-key-difference-training-exercise/","Path":"/everything_crossfit/know-key-difference-training-exercise/","Date":"2015-02-03","Year":"2015","Month":"02","Day":"03","Categories":"Everything CrossFit | Interviews | Performance Advice","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/training_excercise_equipment.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fitness_Equipment.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/training_excercise_equipment.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fitness_Equipment.jpg","Image Alt Text":"training_excercise_equipment | Fitness_Equipment"},{"id":"4096","Title":"How to Live a Less Diet-Obsessed Life, Intuitively","Meta Description":"One neuroscientist defines why dieting is a bad idea and causes more damage than good.

Here is a Better Way...</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe problem with dieting these days is that people tend to interpret it as cutting down drastically on food intake so that they can lose excess fat and look lean and slender. Everyone wants a healthy body but most of them take the wrong route and end up being bulimic or anorexic. Neuroscientist<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/sandra_aamodt_why_dieting_doesn_t_usually_work\" target=\"_blank\"> Sandra Aamodt </a>has now defined clearly as to why dieting is a bad idea and will cause more damage than get fruitful results. Through her, find a fresh approach to live a less diet-obsessed life.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><strong>The problem with dieting</strong></h4>\nShe states how she started dieting at the age of 13 and continued to try different kinds of diets for the next few years. In the middle of all this, she did lose weight only to gain it back again, thus leaving her stupefied as to where she could have gone wrong. The equation was simple – you eat right and then burn it off accordingly. Sandra later figured out that hunger and energy is governed by the brain, which essentially decides what your body weight should be.\n\nYou can alter your lifestyle to lose weight, but the system works like a thermostat – it regulates the signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight and those that direct the body to shed off pounds. No matter what you do, the brain will always push the body back to the weight that is considered to be appropriate. The problem occurs when the brain is set to a new normal weight. For example, if you have temporarily gained 10 pounds and you don’t lose it for a couple of years, the brain thinks that is your normal weight now. So a sudden gain in weight can also cause problems.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><strong>What is the solution?</strong></h4>\nThe bottom line is diets are not reliable at all because there is a 90% chance that you will gain back the exact same weight you had lost, and perhaps even more. Combat this issue using a scientific technique by being mindful of what you eat. Listen to your body when it signals for hunger and learn to control your eating so you can stop when you feel full. It might take some time before you can correctly understand what your brain is trying to tell you regarding food habits, but it is the only way to live life in a healthy and happy manner.\n\nEat regular nutrient-rich meals without getting distracted – your appetite shouldn’t be toyed with in any way!

Learn how to fix it.","Content":"<h2>Why Athletes have Problems during Clean and Jerk?</h2>\n<h2></h2>\nA recent trend has indicated that a lot of newcomers are facing problems in closing the clean and jerk when it comes to weightlifting. The issue lies in the dip portion of the jerk when the lifter reaches the bottom of the dip is beginning to change directions by driving upward.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere are a few points to ensure you don’t have trouble in accomplishing the movement:\n<ul>\n\t<li>During a dip, energy is stored in the quads so that it can be released later. The “later” comes within a fraction of a second during which, the strength reflex build up is utilized to drive the bar overhead. The faster you do the dips, the more upward force you can exert. The upward jerk needs to be completed flawlessly will full commitment because a split second delay can cause a significant loss in energy for the jerk drive.</li>\n\t<li>Hesitating at the bottom of a dip is a strict no-no. The lifter halts and holds the weight in a quarter front squat position for a second. In order to jerk the barbell, the upward thrust should be made as forcefully as possible. This tiny time gap causes a deficit in the force that could be drawn via a quick jerk, so the overall effort isn’t sufficient to jerk a heavy weight in the correct way.</li>\n\t<li>Novice lifters are unable to commit to the lift as they are apprehensive and have a fear regarding the weight. Initially this might not be a hindrance because these lifters don’t have enough strength so they can still accomplish full jerks exerting less force, even with a hesitation dip. But when the barbell gets heavier, it will not be possible for the lifter to maintain consistency.</li>\n\t<li>CrossFitters are trained to equate jerk to thrusters that don’t have dip. They skip the “pause” phase between the clean and the jerk, which causes the bar to be driven off the shoulders just after coming out of the clean. The absence of a dip means zero eccentric movement before the drive. The jerk has to be learned under a qualified coach in the case of CrossFit converts.</li>\n\t<li>After a certain age, the quad tendons of lifters lose the capacity of handling the same amount of force that they used to when he was younger. They will have to relax on the jerk dip or else it might lead to a ruptured patellar tendon.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe jerk movement is easier to control and you can move extremely heavy weights overhead – so try to change direction as fast as you can, so that you can jerk anything you can clean.\n\n&nbsp;","Slug":"one-tiny-tweak-clean-jerk-will-improve-outcome-lifting","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/everything_crossfit/one-tiny-tweak-clean-jerk-will-improve-outcome-lifting/","Path":"/everything_crossfit/one-tiny-tweak-clean-jerk-will-improve-outcome-lifting/","Date":"2015-01-28","Year":"2015","Month":"01","Day":"28","Categories":"Everything CrossFit | How To | Performance Advice","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cleanjerk_technique.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cleanjerk_technique.jpg","Image Alt Text":"clean&jerk_technique"},{"id":"4104","Title":"5 Health Risks of Zero Net Carbs Hype","Content":"<h2>The Bottom Line About Zero Net Carbs Fantasy</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nThere is a new facet to the rage about having low-carb foods since they make you lose weight and help to achieve a leaner body. It is said that instead of cutting calories, people should focus on reducing the carbohydrate intake in order to reduce the extra fat in the liver. But this type of diet imposes a lot of restrictions, which is why it is difficult to stick to it on a regular basis.\n\nWhile there is no shortage of talk about the correct carb intake a body needs, one carb development is discussed less: food can be made with zero net carbs. The massive elephant in the room is this: the words “net carb” on the packaging is enough to make me suspicious. “Net carb” usually means that someone is trying to sell you stuff by telling you a fairy tale.\n\nUnfortunately, marketers have utilized “zero net carbs” as a tool in order to sell off items having low net carbs, even though the FDA doesn’t recognize the term “net carbs”. To put it in a nutshell, products that claim to be having zero net carbs; all of those might not be as harmless as they seem. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves before asking ourselves this question--\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><strong>Why Do Zero Net Carbs Seem Sexy?</strong></h4>\nPer these products’ nutrition claim, the total number of carbohydrates in a food item after deducting the fiber and sugar alcohols is known as net carbohydrates. Zero net carbohydrate products are currently very popular. For instance, The Carb Zero Bread by Julian Bakery is just like a normal slice of bread but without huge amounts of carbohydrates, sugars, and calories. It comprises protein, dietary fiber, and is gluten-free. The fiber and protein keeps the appetite satiated so that there are no sudden hunger pangs that lead to bingeing on snacks. Also remember that fiber and sugar alcohols don’t affect blood sugar adversely. The Smart Carb Bread by the same establishment is also made with similar ingredients and claims to help to shed the excess fat and lose weight at the same time.\n\nHow do you measure net carbs? Check the sugar and fiber content as mentioned on the labels – if the former is more than grams, subtract half the grams of sugar alcohols from the total carbohydrates and adjust accordingly. For the fiber, subtract half the grams of dietary fiber from the total carbohydrates if it is more than 5 grams and then make insulin adjustments.\n\nIt sounds great. Almost too good to be true. Which forces you to ask, is this just another health scam, like “diet” soda? Are companies taking an already unhealthy substandard food product and lacing toxic modified ingredients to cancel out the sugars, calories, and carbs? Should you be worried that your body is being starved out of real nutrition in the pursuit of “weight-shedding”? Let’s get to that.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><strong>Zero Net Carbs is not the Correct Term</strong></h4>\nRight now it is impossible to accept zero net carb marketers’ health claims as accurate. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet set regulations for <a href=\"http://www.dlife.com/diabetes/information/food_and_nutrition/menu_planning/nutrition_facts_labels.html\">label</a> claims about carbohydrates. Meaning we know less about the ramifications of this health food trend.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that some products are blatantly misleading consumers by claiming they contain “zero carbs”, thereby omitting the word “net”, which makes a huge difference. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all nutrition labels to mention the total carb count including the full amount of grams from sugar alcohols and fiber. <em>The real problem here is you are highly dependant on insulin management; these products can have a negative impact on blood sugar.</em>\n\nIn one case, WebMD cited, “When you tell a person 'net carbs' or 'impact carbs,' it's very confusing…A person with diabetes may think, 'It's fine for me to have as much as I want.”\n\nIn another example, one man measured the spike in blood sugar after eating low net carb bread from Julian Bakery. <a href=\"http://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb-bread-another-fairy-tale-bites-the-dust\">The results</a> were drastic increases. The companies boasting the nutrition of these products could not give an explanation or convincing rebuttle to explain the negative sugar spikes.\n\nAfter all this, what should you think about zero net carbs?\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><strong>The bottom line</strong> is that these foods may not be as innocuous as they seem, in terms of blood sugar impact, and most are far from healthy choices. So go easy, test your own response, and then mentally file these products in your “occasional treat” category.</h4>\nOr better yet, give your body what it really wants and needs—nutrient-rich natural food.\n\nSubscribe to <a href=\"http://pages.amrapnutrition.com/subscribe/\" target=\"_blank\">AMRAP's newsletter</a> for more fresh ideas, raw myth busting, and exclusive offers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>References</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/305129-zero-net-carb-foods/\">http://www.livestrong.com/article/305129-zero-net-carb-foods/</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.diabetesforecast.org/2010/aug/what-are-net-carbs.html\">http://www.diabetesforecast.org/2010/aug/what-are-net-carbs.html</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/women/features/net-carb-debate?page=2\">http://www.webmd.com/women/features/net-carb-debate?page=2</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.dlife.com/diabetes-food-and-fitness/carb_counting/about_carbs/carb_confusion\">http://www.dlife.com/diabetes-food-and-fitness/carb_counting/about_carbs/carb_confusion</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.carbzero.com/how-eating-zero-net-carbs-foods-can-help-you-lose-weight/\">http://www.carbzero.com/how-eating-zero-net-carbs-foods-can-help-you-lose-weight/</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb-bread-another-fairy-tale-bites-the-dust\">http://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb-bread-another-fairy-tale-bites-the-dust</a>","Slug":"zero-net-carbs-fitness-trend-substantial-health-risk","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/nutrition_hacks/zero-net-carbs-fitness-trend-substantial-health-risk/","Path":"/nutrition_hacks/zero-net-carbs-fitness-trend-substantial-health-risk/","Date":"2015-01-20","Year":"2015","Month":"01","Day":"20","Categories":"Health Tips | Nutrition Hacks | Reviews | Top 10","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero-net-carb.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/low-carb-bread-list-slices.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_net_carb_foods.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tired_athlete.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero-net-carb.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/low-carb-bread-list-slices.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_net_carb_foods.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tired_athlete.jpg","Image Alt Text":"zero-net-carbzero_net_carb_foods | tired_athlete"},{"id":"4131","Title":"How To Make a Health Resolution and Stick To It","Meta Description":"Rather than blindly writing down a list of what you'd like to accomplish this year, try to keep these four tips in mind when making a health resolution","Content":"<h2>4 Steps to Ensure Your Goals are Realized This Year</h2>\n<h2></h2>\nIt's the most wonderful time of the year: New Years' Resolution time! For those of you that like to start the new year off to a fresh start with new health resolutions and goals to complete, you may find yourself at a standstill once the adrenaline and excitement of a \"new year, new you\" idea fades away as the months go by. Instead, you may find yourself struggling to achieve those once-desired goals.\n\nRather than blindly writing down a list of what you'd like to accomplish, try to keep these tips in mind:\n\n<strong>1. Write down goals that you can actually achieve. </strong>If your average running mileage per week is five miles, chances are you may not be able to run a marathon before the year is up. Likewise, it's unreasonable for not only your body but for your mind to set a goal to lose 100 pounds in a year's time. Instead, create goals that you know you will be able to achieve, but will still be somewhat of a challenge. For example, if you'd like to lose a total of 100 pounds, make it a goal to lose 40-50 of those pounds this year. If you'd like to run a marathon in your lifetime, make it a goal to run a 10K or a half in 2015. By making your goals achievable, you will be more likely to stick to them and in turn will feel motivated to create and accomplish more goals after that.\n\n<b>2. Break down your ultimate goals into smaller, more manageable \"mini goals.\" </b>Taking the example of the weight loss goal from above, divide your 40-50 pound loss in a year's time to each week, or each month. Reward each mini-goal achievement by doing something you enjoy, buying yourself something that you need or want, or even blocking out some time to relax and enjoy the moment. You've reached another step towards your ultimate goal, that deserves some recognition!\n\n<strong>3. Create an action plan. </strong>Want to run that half marathon by the end of the year? Research some training plans that will work for your lifestyle. Once you've chosen something that fits, figure out how you will incorporate said plan into your schedule in a way that will make it seem effortless. When it comes to weight loss, find a health plan that will work for you, or even create your own meal plan based on healthy choices that will help you reach that goal. Write down your meal plan every week so you know what to expect and how to prepare. By creating a plan beforehand, you can avoid the excuses in the long run if it's already woven into your busy schedule.\n\n<strong>4. Visualize your goals and see yourself accomplishing them. </strong>If that means to post your written goals somewhere where you can see them everyday, do it. If that means creating a vision board so you can envision yourself crossing that finish line or finally feeling healthy and confident, do that. Whatever method you need to take in order to give yourself the confidence and reassurance that you can, in fact, do this, utilize it.\n\nIf you have an idea, and then a plan, and then the confidence to believe in yourself, this can be the year that you finally get those resolutions accomplished.","Slug":"make-health-resolution-stick","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/health_tips/make-health-resolution-stick/","Path":"/health_tips/make-health-resolution-stick/","Date":"2015-01-06","Year":"2015","Month":"01","Day":"06","Categories":"Health Tips | How To | Lifestyle Design","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amrap_nutrition_athlete.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amrap_nutrition_athlete.jpg","Image Alt Text":"amrap_nutrition_athlete"},{"id":"4244","Title":"What To Do After A Celiac Disease Diagnosis","Meta Description":"Have you received a celiac disease diagnosis? Read this article for tips on how to successfully live a celiac lifestyle thanks to the gluten-free diet.","Content":"Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease triggered by gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and requires the total elimination of gluten from the diet. Hence, the only treatment for this disease is the gluten-free diet. Paleo and Gluten Free advocate Tina Turbin offers newly-diagnosed celiac patients a step-by-step guide on how to get started eating gluten-free with a surprising ending.\n\nA <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/category/helpful-info/celiac/\" target=\"_blank\">celiac disease diagnosis</a> can bring both relief as well as anxiety, as the standard treatment for celiac disease is the gluten-free diet. As you realize how many commonly eaten foods contain gluten, you may feel overwhelmed by your dietary restrictions. Don’t worry, this apprehension is normal, and short-lived. For soon, with some knowledge and experience, staying gluten-free as a celiac will become a natural way of life and can be a total life saver.\n\nThe first thing to do is empower yourself with knowledge. (You’re on the right track by reading this article in AMRAP!) Consult professionals and resources, which can be found online (such as <a href=\"http://glutenfreehelp.info/gluten-free-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">Free Tip Sheets</a>) in print. You’ll learn details about celiac disease and the gluten-free diet as well as practical advice on how to deal with some of the common obstacles of the gluten-free lifestyle, such as eating out or surviving the many holidays, and even how to cook <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/recipes/\" target=\"_blank\">gluten-free recipes</a>. I also recommend finding a local support group by searching online to find a national celiac disease support organization. They are all over the world these days.\n\nUsing your resources, get prepared to go gluten-free grocery shopping. Familiarize yourself with the common sources of gluten and to learn how to read ingredients labels for gluten. Obtain a list of safe and unsafe foods for you to eat and to carry this list with you at all times. Learn about hidden sources of gluten, such as soups, gravies, medications, and cosmetics.\n\nBefore you go shopping, you can download a helpful Android or iPhone app to help you pick out gluten-free foods, and don’t forget to bring your list of safe and unsafe foods. This first trip to the grocery store is going to be the hardest! Find where and how to shop for gluten-free foods and products. It’s a good idea to check out your local health food store, which should have some options. You can also order gluten-free foods online. Don’t forget to call companies to find out about the gluten content in their products.  That too can change so be sure to read the labels each time.\n\nNow it’s time to tell your family, friends, and others with whom you associate such as coworkers and your boss about your celiac disease diagnosis. With the genetic factor behind celiac disease, it’s important that your relatives also get tested for celiac disease. You can bring coworkers and friends materials about celiac disease, so that they understand your new dietary restrictions.\n\nIf you <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/category/helpful-info/travel/\" target=\"_blank\">travel</a> or eat out a lot, learning how to dine out gluten-free is an important skill to acquire. This can be quite the challenge but your online and print celiac resources will provide practical tips on ordering gluten-free food and avoiding accidental ingestion of gluten thanks to cross-contamination. Websites such as <a href=\"http://glutenfreehelp.info/\">GlutenFreeHelp.info</a> are invaluable.\n\nWhile you adjust to being gluten-free, make sure to have some fun. Learn gluten-free alternatives to your favorite foods, sample world-class <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/category/paleo-desserts/\" target=\"_blank\">gluten-free desserts</a>, and throw gluten-free baking parties. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember that you’re fortunate to have found the answer to your health problems—only 3% of the celiac population in the U.S. are currently correctly diagnosed.\n\nIn  my next article I will discuss what happens after you’ve tried the gluten-free diet yet you do or did not respond well enough or in other words “recover”. Why could that be?

The red cabbage is particularly good at weathering a long winter — unlike it's green cousin which is best <a href=\"http://stupideasypaleo.com/2012/05/16/make-your-own-sauerkraut/%20\" target=\"_blank\">turned into sauerkraut</a> if you want it to survive until spring.\n\nIt's no slouch in the nutrition department, either. A red cabbage has 10 times more vitamin A (most of it in the form of vega-carotene) and twice as much iron as green cabbage. It also packs a big wallop of Vitamin C: 84% of the RDA, along with helpful amounts of potassium (great for regularing heart beat and blood pressure) andn manganese (a carb converter).\n\nPlus, it's a gorgeous color, crispy, slightly spicy, and surprisingly delicious when it's tossed with just a few ingredients. This salad is a breeze to make, holds up well for a few days in the refrigerator, and tastes delicious cold and hot.\n\n<strong>Fun fact:</strong> Red cabbage can turn blue when you cook it!

Slice the cabbage on a mandoline slicer set to the thinnest setting; you can also grate it in a food processor or cut it with a knife. The idea is to get it cole-slaw thin. Place in a large bowl.\n\n2. Add the minced parsley, lemon juice, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the cabbage. Toss with your hands, squeezing the lemon juice into the cabbage. Drizzle the olive oil over the top and mix again.\n\n3. Allow the flavors to meld at room temperature before eating, about 20 minutes. Taste and add more salt, pepper, and/or lemon juice if it needs it. Devour!\n\nThis lasts in the fridge 2-3 days, then the flavors become muted. If it loses its oomph before you can eat it all raw, toss it in a skillet with some browned ground beef or lamb and stir-fry until everything is hot and caramelized. It's a great last-minute, one-pot meal.","Slug":"crisp-red-cabbage-salad","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/nutrition_hacks/crisp-red-cabbage-salad/","Path":"/nutrition_hacks/crisp-red-cabbage-salad/","Date":"2015-02-12","Year":"2015","Month":"02","Day":"12","Categories":"Nutrition Hacks | Paleo Recipes","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cabbage-22.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Cabbagedfd.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/redcabbage.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cabbage-22.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Cabbagedfd.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/redcabbage.jpg"},{"id":"4309","Title":"Chinese Slow-Cooker Pork Ribs","Meta Description":"Chinese five-spice powder adds Asian flair to slow-cooker pork ribs for fall-off-the-bone meat that's flavorful and tender.","Content":"<h2>Super easy, crazy delicious</h2>\nThis is going to seem like an odd thing for a cookbook author to say, but sometimes I just really can't bear to make dinner.\n\nDon't get me wrong!

You just got out of work. You're tired, exhausted, and drained. You planned to go to the gym at 4:00; Adopt these 3 fitness habits made easy.","Content":"<h2>Fitness Habits Made Easy</h2>\nIt's 3:00. You just got out of work. You're tired, exhausted, and drained. You planned to go to the gym at 4:00. You still have to go home, change up, eat a pre-workout snack, and then get going. Just the thought of merely getting ready to go to the gym makes you sleepy.\n\nDoes this sound familiar? If it does, it may be a result of poor planning. Even though you may have \"planned\" to work out, did you really plan it, or was it a thought in the back of your mind?\n\nEveryone leads a busy lifestyle. There's lots of other, sometimes more important, things on our mind that can hinder our desire and ability to work out. Fortunately, there are some ways to combat this mindset and get yourself 100% prepared to tackle your next workout.\n\n<strong>1. Plan your schedule as early in advance as you can. </strong>Write out your workout schedule early to ensure that you won't bail on your health. Write out the workouts you are planning on completing the week before, with the exact time you will be doing them. If you are unable to plan ahead that early, write it down a few days or the day before. By writing down your fitness schedule, you are less likely to skip it. Think of it as a business meeting: if you write it down, and schedule it at a convenient time, don't cancel. You wouldn't cancel an important meeting, so why cancel on a time to improve on yourself?\n\n<strong>2. Decide your location. </strong>Will you work out from home, or will you go to your gym? Be specific about your location. If you will stay at home, figure out what, exactly, your workout is going to consist of. If you're going to head to the gym, decide if you will take a class, hop on a machine, or take a swim in the pool. The more specific you are, the better planned you will be.\n\n<strong>3. Pack your bag. </strong>If you are going to the gym for your workout, pack a gym bag with your essentials, including a pre-workout snack if needed. This will save a trip home because you will already have everything you need. If you are going before work, pack clothes and shower necessities as well. If you are working out from home, pick out your clothes the night before. That way, instead of having to waste time picking out clothes, you will be prepared to change quickly and get the workout started.\n\nBy following these three golden rules, you will be more likely to follow your workout routine the way you want. By planning ahead of time, you avoid spending time thinking about it and mulling it over before it becomes something you skip. Spending more time planning beforehand results in success at the gym or at home.","Slug":"3-tips-ensure-crush-next-workout","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/lifestyle_design/3-tips-ensure-crush-next-workout/","Path":"/lifestyle_design/3-tips-ensure-crush-next-workout/","Date":"2015-02-02","Year":"2015","Month":"02","Day":"02","Categories":"Lifestyle Design","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bicyclemaneuver.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bicyclemaneuver.jpg","Image Alt Text":"bicycle_maneuver"},{"id":"4515","Title":"Must See Coaching on Paleo for Endurance","Meta Description":"Nell Stephenson discusses the benefits she's seen using Paleo for Endurance in her own life and among her clients. This article is a must see on nutrition.","Content":"<h2>Do you Run Triathalons, Marathons, or even 5Ks? Paleoista talks brass tax...</h2>\nOver the years, I’ve had the chance to work with clients from every walk of life, from those in the process of recovering from illness to those striving for a lifelong weight loss goal.\n\nThe fact that all of us can improve our health by following the same common sense way of eating, regardless of our background illustrates how significant what we put in our bodies and how healthy, or not, we are, really is.\n\nOne of my favorite demographics to work with is those who share the love of the same sport as I do: Ironman Triathlons.\n\nI began racing long course in 2001 and it wasn’t until four years later than I learned about Dr. Cordain’s work as well as the collaboration he’d undertaken with Joe Friel, which resulted in <em>The Paleo Diet for Athletes </em>(Rodale, 2005).\n\nUp until then, despite having tried nearly every sports nutrition product in the media as well as several popular diets, including Vegan, Blood Type and The Zone, not even the best training regime and what I thought was a sound nutrition plan ever seemed to do the trick of fueling me, keeping me lean and avoiding gastric distress.\n\nOnce I learned about the Paleo Diet, began incorporating it into my own life and felt firsthand how powerful it was, I simply had to begin sharing the information with my clients. Paleo for Endurance had tangible benefits for myself and my athletes.\n\nI didn’t get there in one fell swoop; in fact, I was just gluten-free for a year prior to embarking on my Paleo regime in 2005. But once I learned about True Paleo, and I became a faster athlete who could recover better, perform at a higher level than I ever dreamed, rarely experienced any sort of sickness and witnessed better sleep and recovery than ever before, there was no going back.\n\nAs I began counseling clients on how to implement Paleo into their lives and saw changes they demonstrated, I became more and more passionate about teaching as many people as possible about this way of eating and living.\n\nAdmittedly, back then I was probably a bit too dogmatic, but for no other reason than I knew how much benefit there was to be gained from it.\n\nI have learned along the way, however, that this is not necessarily the best approach and it can actually put people off if they feel the only approach is all or nothing. While I still whole-heartedly believe that we all do have so much to gain from following this regime at a 100% commitment level, the reality is that even small steps in that direction demonstrates positive change.\n\nThere are grey areas, both with regard to food choices and situations.\n\nTo present Paleo as all or nothing, I learned, would imply that when one is in a challenging situation, there’s no choice but to cave (pardon the pun) and go with a low quality food choice. To that end, I began to be a bit more open minded for foods that may not actually be freshly picked, freshly caught or freshly hunted.\n\nIn other words, there’s a time and a place for something that may be a step or two away from that now and then.\n\nAs an athlete, I’m always interested in what the new products are on the market and how they might be just what I’ve been looking for. So when I learned about AMRAP, which presented itself as a Paleo friendly bar, I was thrilled. Even more so because, to my knowledge, it was the first one out there that actually was Paleo!\n\nI’d seen a few others, but since they were made with pea and rice protein, I wasn’t exactly interested in testing them out.\n\nIt really is a viable option and I’ve now got many athletes using them for their travel-related races as well as recovery when real, fresh food isn’t an option.\n\nAnd while it may sound like I’m writing this post just to sell a little AMRAP, I’m not. I wanted to support one of the first products I learned about that helps to further what a well rounded, True Paleo approach is all about.\n\nFor me, and for many of my clients, lifelong balance and staying on track includes sometimes choosing an option that is simply the one that makes the most sense given the situation at hand.\n\nThe message is not ‘eat lots of bars every day’ but rather, to know which options that call themselves Paleo, and now, there are far too many that are so far from it, it’s hard to see how they can use the word, really are, and to support what they’re doing.","Slug":"must-see-coaching-paleo-endurance","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/must-see-coaching-paleo-endurance/","Path":"/interesting_other/must-see-coaching-paleo-endurance/","Date":"2015-02-24","Year":"2015","Month":"02","Day":"24","Categories":"Interesting Other","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/nell_stephenson_running.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/nell_stephenson_running.jpg","Image Alt Text":"nell_stephenson_running"},{"id":"4603","Title":"Why Diets Fail and How to Make Yours Work","Meta Description":"why diets fail and how to make yours work begins with understanding the difference between a diet and lifestyle. Longterm health is scalable and permanent.","Content":"<h2>Longterm Health is Scalable; Your Food Template Makes the Difference.</h2>\nThe problem with dieting these days is that people tend to interpret it as cutting down drastically on food intake so that they can lose excess fat and look lean and slender. Everyone wants a healthy body but most of them take the wrong route and end up being bulimic or anorexic. Neuroscientist Sandra Aamodt has now defined clearly as to why dieting is a bad idea and will cause more damage than get fruitful results.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The problem with dieting</strong>\n\nThere is a clear reason why diets fail. Dr. Aamodt describes how she started dieting at the age of 13 and continued to try different kinds of diets for the next few years. In the middle of all this, she did lose weight only to gain it back again, thus leaving her stupefied as to where she could have gone wrong. The equation was simple – you eat right and then burn it off accordingly. Sandra later figured out that hunger and energy is governed by the brain, which essentially decides what your body weight should be.\n\nYou can alter your lifestyle to lose weight, but the system works like a thermostat – it regulates the signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight and those that direct the body to shed off pounds. No matter what you do, the brain will always push the body back to the weight that is considered to be appropriate. The problem occurs when the brain is set to a new normal weight. For example, if you have temporarily gained 10 pounds and you don’t lose it for a couple of years, the brain thinks that is your normal weight now. So a sudden gain in weight can also cause problems.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What is the solution?</strong>\n\nThe bottom line is diets are not reliable at all because there is a 90% chance that you will gain back the exact same weight you had lost, and perhaps even more. Combat this issue using a scientific technique by being mindful of what you eat. Listen to your body when it signals for hunger and learn to control your eating so you can stop when you feel full. It might take some time before you can correctly understand what your brain is trying to tell you regarding food habits, but it is the only way to live life in a healthy and happy manner.\n\nEat regular nutrient-rich meals without getting distracted – your appetite shouldn’t be toyed with in any way!

It is widely accepted that any effects of coffee consumption on sports performance are linked to the caffeine in coffee, rather than to coffee per se. Caffeine is widely understood to be an ergogenic aid i.e. a substance that improves the capacity to do work or exercise. That said, you are likely overdoing it with your morning caffeine intake. Understand the benefits of coffee in the right doses, and use our kickass alternative energy tip to awaken your body.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Benefits of Coffee</strong>\n\nClearly not all coffees are created equal. The liquid candy lattes with whip cream won’t give you the benefits that simple coffee can afford, and the latter is what we’re talking about. In small quantities, caffeine from coffee or tea has been linked with increased endurance during workouts and an overall ability to work and exercise with less perceived exertion. Researchers will quickly point out that in higher doses, coffee and the caffeine within it does not improve energy or physical capacity. It does not behoove you to chug gallon after gallon. You’re likely hurting your efforts to live an active lifestyle.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Risks of Coffee</strong>\n\nCoffee might help you power through a workout or a meeting, but that flip side to caffeine overuse is downright miserable. I’ll say again that caffeine in high doses does not enhance athletic performance any further than low to moderate intake. In fact, if you are overdoing it and your morning coffee bleeds over into lunch and cocktail hour, you’ll likely start feeling--\n<ul>\n\t<li>Restlessness</li>\n\t<li>Insomnia, and</li>\n\t<li>Anxiety</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Recommended Daily Dose</strong>\n\nAmericans drink a shit-load of coffee and tea, but mostly coffee. It sustains us, but with any health advice, people should drink coffee or team in moderation, as too much of a good thing can be…well dangerous. Follow this rule of thumb for your moderating your caffeine intake:\n<ul>\n\t<li>400 MG for men (No more than 4 cups of coffee)</li>\n\t<li>300 MG for women (roughly 3 cups or less).</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nSo where do you find the other 2 cups of caffeine you've just cut out?

This soup is made slightly exotic with spices inspired by the cuisine of Persia, and the addition of a few potatoes gives it a velvety texture. This recipe is ridiculously easy to make, so it's equally great for weekday meals or a fancy dinner party. Because it has a tomato base, this Winter Vegetable Soup will taste even better on the second and third day than it does on the first, and the spices mellow over time.\n\n<strong>Winter Vegetable Soup</strong>\n<em>Serves 10-12 | Prep 20 minutes | Cook 90 minutes | <a href=\"http://www.whole30.com\" target=\"_blank\">Whole30</a> compliant</em>\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4640\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/persian_winter-veg_soup_blog-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"persian_winter-veg_soup_blog\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />\n\n<strong>Ingredients:</strong>\n<strong> Soup:</strong>\n2 tablespoons ghee or other cooking fat\n2 pounds butternut squash, peeled, seeded, chopped into 1-inch cubes\n2 medium onions, coarsely diced\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n1 pound organic white potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks\n4 teaspoons ground cumin\n2 teaspoons ground paprika\n1/2 to 2 teaspoons <a href=\"http://theclothesmakethegirl.com/2011/05/08/killer-kebab-spice-mix/\" target=\"_blank\">Aleppo pepper</a> (or crushed red pepper flakes)\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1 tablespoon salt\n1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste\n6 cups broth (any flavor)\n\n<strong>Pistachio-Parsley Pesto:</strong>\n1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil\n1 cup fresh parsley leaves\n1 small clove garlic\n2 tablespoons shelled pistachios\n1/2 teaspoon lemon juice\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper\n\n<strong>Directions:</strong>\n1. Heat a large soup pot over medium heat. Add fat and allow it to melt, then toss in the butternut squash, onions, garlic, and potatoes. Stir to coat the veggies with the fat and cook, without browning, until the vegetables are beginning to soften and look golden, about 20-30 minutes. You don’t want anything to get brown, so keep an eye on the heat.\n\n2. Add the cumin, paprika, Aleppo pepper, cinnamon, salt, and black pepper to the pot. Stir to combine. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.\n\n3. Add the broth to the pot and stir to combine, scraping up any brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Simmer, covered, until squash is tender when poked with a fork, about 20-30 minutes.\n\n4. While the Winter Vegetable Soup is cooking, prepare the pistachio-parsley pesto. Purée all the ingredients — with a blender, food processor, or stick blender — until very smooth. Set aside. (See below for additional, delicious garnishes.)\n\n5. When the soup is done, purée it carefully with a stick blender, blender, or food processor; work in batches, if necessary. When it’s smooth, taste and adjust seasonings. You can add water or broth, 1/4 cup at a time, if it’s too thick. Serve in a shallow bowl and top with your favorite garnishes.\n<h2>Tasty Garnish Ideas</h2>\nWinter Vegetable Soup is delicious just the way it is, but if you add a garnish or two, it turns into something really special. Just add a touch of any or all (!) of these on top. In the photo, I used Pistachio-Parsley Pesto and Onion-Raisin Relish, but all of the options listed here are delicious and guaranteed to fight food boredom.\n\n<strong>Onion-Raisin Relish:</strong> Stir-fry half of a onion in 1 tablespoon cooking fat with 1-2 tablespoons raisins until the raisins are soft, and the onion is browned and crisp.\n\n<strong>Whipped Coconut Cream:</strong> Refrigerate a can of coconut milk overnight; Thai Kitchen works really well. When the coconut milk is cold, flip the can upside down and open the bottom with a can opener. Pour off any liquid that’s separated and scoop the thickened coconut milk into the bowl of mixer. Whip on your mixer’s highest setting until the milk is fluffy and has taken on the texture of whipped cream, about 5-7 minutes.

I've used older eggs. I've pricked the shells and added baking soda to the cooking water. I've even baked them. But still: the shell stuck to the white and by the time I was done trying to peel them, they looked like someone had already taken a few bites.\n\nThen my husband Dave forwarded me a blog post outlining a technique that promised to work: lower the cold eggs into boiling hot water.

The pot should be big enough to comfortably hold the number of eggs you're cooking and enough water to cover them by about an inch or two.\n\n2. Use a large ladle or spoon to lower the eggs into the boiling water, one at a time. Place them gently in the pot so they don't crack. (If they do crack, no biggie. But let's not crack our eggs too soon.)\n\n3. Reduce the heat on the pan to simmer and cook for 11 minutes for hard-boiled, 9 1/2 minutes if you want the yolks to still be a little gelatinous. <strong>Set a timer.</strong>\n\n4. While the eggs are simmering, prepare an ice bath. You need to shock those eggs! Fill a large bowl with plenty of ice and cold water. Wait for the timer to go off.\n\n5. When the eggs are finished, remove them from the pot with a slotted spoon and lower them into the ice bath. Let them chill out for at least 15 minutes, but you can forget about them for a while, if you want — or put the bowl in the fridge over night.\n\n6. When you're ready to peel the eggs, crack the shells all over; you want lots of little cracks! Then use your fingernails to start peeling. They should be smooth, glossy, and ready to be devoured.

See how Paleo addresses it.","Content":"<h2>Find a Balance with Bio-available and Low Glycemic Foods. Here's How...</h2>\nI’ve decided to approach the topics of the <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-diet/the-paleo-diet/\" target=\"_blank\">Paleo Diet</a>, also known as the caveman diet and paleolithic diet and how this relates to low glycemic, or man’s blood sugar. How has man’s health been affected? These are topics that directly address man’s ills and physical betterment through the Paleo Diet and low glycemic control.\n\nIn my research and experiences on my quest to impart more truth concerning greater health and <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/health/live-less-diet-obsessed-life-intuitively/\" target=\"_blank\">longevity</a>, I’ve explored a variety of diets and health regimens. It has never become so clear to me how much our health and<a title=\"How to Guarantee Your Quality of Life\" href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/health/guarantee-quality-life/\" target=\"_blank\"> quality of life</a> are dependent upon the food we eat, since seeing in myself and in my family the transformative results just from eating a biologically appropriate diet, the Paleo diet, which is grain-free and thus <a title=\"What the Gluten-Free Diet Fad Teaches You About Healthy Eating\" href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/nutrition/gluten-free-diet-fad-teaches-healthy-eating/\" target=\"_blank\">gluten-free</a> and legume free. This also translates into a low glycemic diet as well. Some have named this simple diet the caveman diet, the paleolithic diet and what-have you, but in essence it has been deemed “man’s original” diet.” So yeah, yeah, there are twenty different ways to describe it, but what will this unique approach to food teach me?\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Paleo Diet's effect on insulin and blood sugar</h4>\nThe paleo diet is based on the premise that humans do best when eating the foods our ancestors ate prior to the advent of agriculture and animal husbandry in 10,000 B.C. This proven theory is that modern humans do best on paleolithic nutrition because human genetics have largely remained the same since the preagricultural era, and thus our genetic makeup is best suited to the <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-recipes/why-paleo/\" target=\"_blank\">ancestral human diet</a>. Taking our current bodily structure and feeding it the ancestral human diet is having profound effects on the general health and wellbeing of those participating in studies, not to mention the fact that this diet has a much lower glycemic impact on our blood sugar.\n\nAccording to research, pre-agricultural humans were free of the diseases of the civilized world such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, and <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/category/helpful-info/autoimmune-disease/\" target=\"_blank\">autoimmune diseases</a>. Modern studies, including clinical studies, have shown as well that eating paleo can help or reduce the risk of a variety of serious health conditions. This includes issues associated with high insulin and blood sugar levels, which can lead to a variety of diseases and health conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol levels, obesity, type 2 diabetes and gout. That’s because many or most foods on the paleo diet are low-glycemic, which is evidenced in the ills that paleo dieters are void of; ills that are now classified as “normal” or aging.\n\nGrains are biologically similar to table sugar, causing an unhealthy spike in <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/weight-loss-fitness/hormones-and-paleo/\" target=\"_blank\">insulin</a> upon consumption. Most of the carbohydrates consumed on the paleo diet, consisting of vegetables and fruits, are low-glycemic. Honey, maple syrups etc. are debatable and this is another topic all together.\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>What’s the big deal about the <a href=\"http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/weight-loss/plans/diets/the-slow-carb-diet/\" target=\"_blank\">Glycemic Index</a>?</h4>\nAccording to studies, a low-glycemic diet can help with obesity, type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome, cardiovascular disease and other conditions. Some of the benefits of low glycemic eating include: improved weight loss, decreased hypoglycemia, steadier moods, and reduced <a title=\"Paleo lunch ideas for the workplace\" href=\"http://balancedbites.com/21dsd\" target=\"_blank\">food cravings</a>, which means less binging. This also means less overweight children with early onset diabetes which is a growing concern.\n\nIt is to our benefit that we all take a good look at our diets. Let’s determine if what we are eating could be causing health conditions which could possibly be reversed or avoided should we be willing to entertain the idea of change. The change could be as simple as taking a sincere look at man’s original diet, the diet we were biologically designed to live on. Could this be a door we need to open, and step in with our eyes wide open?\n\nTina Turbin\n\nFeatured Image: <a href=\"http://paleoleap.com/chocolate-oranges/\" target=\"_blank\">Paleoleap.com</a>","Slug":"use-paleo-balance-blood-sugar-levels","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/nutrition_hacks/use-paleo-balance-blood-sugar-levels/","Path":"/nutrition_hacks/use-paleo-balance-blood-sugar-levels/","Date":"2015-02-17","Year":"2015","Month":"02","Day":"17","Categories":"Health Tips | Lifestyle Design | Nutrition Hacks","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/orange-chocolates.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/orange-chocolates.jpg","Image Alt Text":"chocolate_oranges"},{"id":"4658","Title":"How Can Guest Blogging for AMRAP Nutrition Overturn Obesity?","Meta Description":"Guest blogging for AMRAP Nutrition gives you the platform to share insights you've learned on becoming better athletes and healthier humans.","Content":"<h2>Trainers, Gym Owners, Food Writers, Happiness Aficionados, Registered Dieticians---Let your expertise do <em><strong>the most</strong></em> good.</h2>\nWe're not even being overly dramatic.

If new to Paleo or suspicious of grain-free diets practicality, read on.","Content":"<h2>Can You Share Joy in a Grain-Free Lifestyle?</h2>\nIf you just began a Paleo or grain-free lifestyle and are looking for a resource that not only provides a breakdown of the most important things you need to know but also gives you complete, well-balanced meals, <em>Against All Grain: Delectable Paleo Recipes to Eat Well and Feel Great</em> may be your ticket to stay on track. Written by Danielle Walker, this cookbook is more than just a bunch of recipes thrown together. It offers insight into a grain-free, Paleo lifestyle, and tells you exactly what you need to know in order to ditch the grain for good.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>Can you relate to grain-related digestion woes?</h4>\nAfter Walker describes firsthand how the Paleo diet virtually eliminated almost all of her digestion issues she was facing, she goes on to provide readers with a “roadmap” of foods to eat, foods to avoid, and additional reading material to check out. She then gives readers more information on tips for maintaining a new healthy lifestyle as well as detailed descriptions of many of the ingredients and equipment featured in the recipes she uses. These sections are crucial to the overall practicality of the book because it provides readers with important background information that is necessary in order to truly see how beneficial this lifestyle is.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>My husband doesn't eat Paleo. Will he like this?</h4>\nThe recipes themselves are fantastic. Not only are they organized by meal type; they are labeled based on your specific dietary needs. Walker categorizes each recipe as being egg-free, nut-free, a specific carbohydrate diet, and/or vegan. That way, not only are you choosing a dish that’s Paleo-friendly, but you can also customize a unique meal plan based on your own health preference. Personally, the berries and cream breakfast recipe and the basic cauli-rice side dish recipe were two of my favorites!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>I need more than a cookbook, I need a meal survival guide. How does this help?</h4>\nAfter the grand selection of recipes, there are some great resources that Against All Grain cookbook provides in the back of the book. One section, titled “Menu Suggestions,” offers sample menus of recipes that pair well together for special events. For example, the “Light Ladies’ Luncheon” menu consists of the curried chicken salad, the summer island salad, and the currant scones with the rosemary-blueberry smash beverage. These menu suggestions show that Walker takes pride in her work and offers readers small details to make their lives a little more organized and a little easier.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>How will my health change by following this book?</h4>\nAnother section, titled “Success Stories,” details the gratitude that many of her fans felt after trying recipes in Against All Grain cookbook and seeing a health change in themselves or someone they love. This section really gives personality and meaning to the book. This book is not a simple recipe resource for someone who wants to cook with good health in mind—Walker has changed people’s lives and the way they look at food, which is not an easy feat.\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>What do you think as an athlete and busy human being?</h4>\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this book. I felt like I gained a wealth of knowledge about living a grain-free lifestyle that I may not have gotten from an ordinary cookbook. Walker breaks down the barrier of the traditional cookbook by offering a dose of personalization and a lot of flair to go with it. This book is not only a resource that provides you with nutritious and delicious recipes; it delivers important health facts and useful tips to go along with it. Walker states, \"I hope this book will be a medium to share my healing journey with a greater population that I could ever have reached with my blog, as well as make the transition to a grain-free diet enjoyable.\" That is one of the most important aspects of the book. To make your journey <em>enjoyable</em>.\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>Without joy, how can you possibly make it a lifestyle?</h4>\nWalker truly shines in her ability to create a book that is not only accessible, but adaptable to your life.

This is the case among high-intensity and endurance athletes. And there is logical and proven reasons behind training in a fasted state.

I recommend an espresso, but that is always optional. Then go straight for your workout.\n\nWhat will all this do for you? Establishing this daily practice is a way to train your ability to<strong> use fat as fuel</strong> and achieve better performance in the long term.\n<h4>Timing is everything.</h4>\nI recommend starting to workout fasted with any of your trainings lasting less than 1 hour. And build it up month by month, year by year to a personal maximum, in order to get all the benefits of fasted trainings.\n\n<a title=\"Beets by Paleo: How to Make Beet Juice\" href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/beets-paleo-make-beet-juice/\" target=\"_blank\">Hydration = (fluid + electrolytes)</a> should be a must during all your activity, never cut it down!\n\nWhat you will find with the fasted trainings and with patience is:\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Mind and body.</strong> You will develop a body and a mind capable of working in a more uncomfortable environment. The better you become at training in tough conditions, the better athlete you will be and that is when great athletic achievements take place. Be aware that you have to build this “uncomfortable” way of using fat as fuel step-by-step.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Body composition.</strong> Your body composition will be easier to maintain, especially if you use the post-workout recovery window to really have some quality nutrition in your system after a fasted workout. There is an ideal window of 15 minutes right after you finish a fasted workout when you have to replace the glycogen reserves and remember to include some protein and fat, as well as fluid levels and sodium that you depleted. Your <a title=\"How to Get Started in The Paleo Diet\" href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/nutrition_hacks/get-started-paleo-diet/\" target=\"_blank\">high quality paleo nutrition</a> comes to a very important role here and I've found simple whole-food bars are ideal for that window in my own coaching and elite athlete experience.

Notice that while most people rely on sugar for energy, the sugar-burning state is a stressful one, one in which other processes in your body slow down as part of the fight-or-flight response that sugar is so well suited for. Your mind and body will begin to experience more enjoyable and productive training when fat is used as fuel over carbs.\n\nFrom my own experience of taking up to four gels per hour of long or ultra distance training or racing, I managed to train my body and my mind to perform with ¼ of those carbohydrates in really intense or long races, lasting up to 15 hours. It took me three years to build my fasted trainings from 1 hour to up to 6 hours and with great results. What did it take? Patience, long time, paleo nutrition and fasted trainings--longer and longer ones over time.\n\nIs that easy? There is no easy way, there are no silver bullets. How to start?

Use these smart shopper tips to stock Paleo fridge essentials.","Content":"<h2>What Paleo Fridge Essentials Should You Shop For?</h2>\nPaleo friends out there know that one of the first stops during a grocery store trip is the produce aisle. It's important to have a fridge stocked with essentials when practicing a Paleo approach to health. So, what should you be looking for when searching the supermarket for decent fruits and vegetables? Here are some tips that I use when shopping in my favorite aisle of the grocery store:\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n<h4><em>When shopping for pineapples, the greener the skin, the tarter the fruit. </em></h4>\nAt least, that's what I've found. I don't like my pineapples that sweet, so when I shop for them, I tend to look for ones that are darker green in color.</li>\n\t<li>\n<h4><i>The firmer the mango, the better. </i></h4>\nI'm not a huge fan of soft fruits (it's a texture thing), so I look for mangoes that are firm. I've also found that the firmer mangoes, when peeled and chopped, have a longer fridge life.</li>\n\t<li>\n<h4><em>The same goes for melon. </em></h4>\nFor honeydew melon and cantaloupe, I buy them firmer. Again, I've found that they last longer in the fridge prepared than the softer ones do. I think they taste better as well.</li>\n\t<li>\n<h4><em>Grab the celery hearts if you're snacking, and the full bundle of celery if you're cooking. </em></h4>\nI like buying the celery hearts if I'm going to be eating them raw because they take less time to prepare and typically look more appealing than the full celery. If you're cooking with them in soups or other recipes, buying the bundle of celery can be a better choice. That way, you can utilize the portions that you don't eat by saving them for a vegetable broth.</li>\n\t<li>\n<h4><em>Buy the bag of regular carrots, not baby. </em></h4>\nI've always found that the baby carrots retain a lot of water in the bags they come in, which can sometimes ruin them faster than the regular bags of carrots. I like to buy the big bags of carrots for cooking and snacking. I've found that they taste fresher.</li>\n</ol>\nKeeping in mind the quality of your produce when shopping can not only result in more delicious fruits and vegetables, but ones that last longer too.\n\n&nbsp;","Slug":"5-tips-creating-paleo-friendly-fridge","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/health_tips/5-tips-creating-paleo-friendly-fridge/","Path":"/health_tips/5-tips-creating-paleo-friendly-fridge/","Date":"2015-04-01","Year":"2015","Month":"04","Day":"01","Categories":"Health Tips | How To | Lifestyle Design","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paleo_produce_aisle.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Produce-aisle.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bagofgroceries.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paleo_produce_aisle.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Produce-aisle.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bagofgroceries.jpg","Image Alt Text":"paleo_produce_aisle | bagofgroceries"},{"id":"4748","Title":"How Hydration Affects Performance - Part 1","Meta Description":"In athletics, hydration is close to an exact science. Learn how hydration affects performance to avoid the mistake of underestimating its role in nutrition.","Content":"<h2>The Guide to R<em>eally</em> Stay Hydrated 100% of the Time</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen we talk about hydration, we have to think about the following formula:\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Hydration = Fluid + Electrolytes (also called minerals)</strong></p>\nEspecially among competitive athletes, our racing and training hydration-nutrition formula will look something like this:\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Performance = <strong>Hydration</strong> + Carbohydrate + Fat + Protein</p>\nIf we think about carbohydrate and fat usage, we can certainly train our bodies to use them in different ways, becoming more efficient, for example by using <a title=\"Must See Coaching on Paleo for Endurance\" href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/must-see-coaching-paleo-endurance/\">paleo nutrition</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/everything_crossfit/fasted-training-higher-performance/?preview=true\" target=\"_blank\">fasted trainings</a> as we have discussed before.\n\nStill, when it comes to hydration, that is one of the few things in sport science that we cannot minimize or cut back. Unlike the positive benefits of training on a carb deficit, hydration is not an area to skimp and expect athletic progress. Yet, much of the time hydration is underestimated, especially under the focus of performance nutrition.\n\nConsider this question for a moment: have you ever reflected on the fact that you can actually move, exercise and even race almost without any food or “proper nutrition”---for an extended time period? Even though your performance goes down abruptly, it is likely that you have slugged through a workout without food.\n\nThe same does not hold true with fluids. You can’t avoid fluid and electrolyte intake in a very short period of time! Don’t forget that we are made of up to 60-75% of water.  The point I am making is to emphasize the importance of hydration, even over the importance of nutrition.\n\nI will simplify and give you straight and sharp information, so you will really understand in a practical way this concept and apply it in a personalized way to yourself as an athlete.\n\nBy understanding this formula, you will be able to adjust your fluid individual needs and electrolytes depending on your very personal genetics, training and racing conditions. Hydration as nutrition is individual and should be personalized to a maximum to achieve great performance.\n\nThe basis for hydration is the fluid by excellence: water. And of course electrolytes that come to an important role: <em>sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium.</em>\n\nOf these four, the key electrolyte for hydration is sodium. Before talking about our key electrolyte, let’s understand the role of the other three to appreciate our bodies important relationship to electrolytes.\n\n1) <strong>Calcium.</strong> Your body has vast supplies stored in the bones, which are tapped into when needed. Generally in a well-nourished athlete eating a healthy diet with enough vitamin D to help calcium absorption, calcium deficiency during training or racing is rare. <a href=\"http://greatist.com/health/18-surprising-dairy-free-sources-calcium\" target=\"_blank\">Dietary sources</a> are generally better than supplements. Equally important are weight-bearing exercises, especially for lower impact sports such as cycling and swimming.\n\n2) <strong>Magnesium.</strong> Prolonged exercise and training with poor diet can lead to depletion, although this is rare to surface in an acute setting. Deficiency can lead to dizziness, fatigue and depression. It is interesting to note that there is no evidence that magnesium supplementation in athletes with normal blood levels offers any benefit in sports performance. However, <a href=\"http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/peak32.htm\" target=\"_blank\">weightlifters, crossfitters and wrestlers tend to be magnesium deficient</a> and may benefit from oral supplementation.\n\n3) <strong>Potassium.</strong> Low blood potassium (hypokalemia) is usually due to diarrhea, fasting and taking certain drugs such as long-term diuretics. In sports, hypokalemia is rare. Certain ultra-endurance athletes who generally have a poor solid food diet may be prone to hypokalemia leading to nausea, muscle fatigue and weakness. Supplements should always be taken with caution and on the advice of a doctor. Now, although potassium can help athletes avoid cramps, without added sodium, potassium doesn’t maximize hydration.\n\n<em>Now let’s talk about the key electrolyte:</em>\n\n4) <strong>Sodium. </strong>It is not only the most likely electrolyte to be lost, it is also the most likely to be required during training and racing. Sodium is also essential for transport of water in the body. Your body cannot excrete and move free water-instead it moves with sodium. Low blood sodium in sports is mostly due to the dilutional effects of drinking water or low concentration sports drinks in excess of sweat and urine sodium losses. This condition is also known as Exercise Associated Hyponatremia (EAH). With EAH the athlete experiences weakness, nausea, muscle fatigue and cramping. As sodium levels drop even further and water moves into the brain there may be agitation, seizures and occasionally death. Risk factors for EAH include long (4 hr+) races, slow running pace, female gender, low body weight, pre-race excessive water intake, over-drinking (&gt;1.5 l/hr) during racing and abundance of drinks during the event.\n\nSo now that we understand this we can further simplify our hydration formula to:\n\n<strong>Hydration = Water + Sodium</strong>\n\nNow that you have understood the importance of hydration, and the role of water and sodium, my next article, Hydration for Performance Part 2, will guide you on how to personalize your volume of fluid intake or water needed in your sport activity, as well as the concentration you need of sodium per volume of water you drink while pushing your body to the limit to really stay 100% hydrated at all time!\n\n&nbsp;","Slug":"hydration-affects-performance-part-1","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/hydration-affects-performance-part-1/","Path":"/interesting_other/hydration-affects-performance-part-1/","Date":"2015-03-23","Year":"2015","Month":"03","Day":"23","Categories":"Interesting Other","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/crossfit_athlete_performance2.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/crossfit_athlete_performance2.jpg","Image Alt Text":"crossfit_athlete_performance2"},{"id":"4769","Title":"Paleo Peach-Almond Crisp","Meta Description":"This Paleo Peach-Almond Crisp is the perfect dessert for a weeknight or a special celebration.

Or is controlling success possible?","Content":"<h2>What is the Role of Success on Mental Toughness and Enhanced Performance?</h2>\nWe have all heard the saying “focus on what you can control.” Well this is a whole lot easier said than done; however, there seems to be some real value in learning to do so. Focusing on results is what comes most naturally for us, but unfortunately results are not something we can fully control. Or are they?\n\nI conducted an informal study where I was examining the relationship between the amount of effort an athlete puts into practice/preparation with the results the athlete has in competition. What I found was quite amazing; 80 out of 96 athletes interviewed said effort in practice / preparation was the single most significant factor in controlling success in competition.\n\nTo get an idea how your effort level compares with competition results answer the following two questions;\n<ol>\n\t<li>On a scale of 1-10 (where 10 is the greatest effort possible and 1 is almost no effort) how much effort have you put in to your practice/preparation this week?</li>\n\t<li>On a scale of 1-10 (where 10 indicates great results and 1 is far less than desired results) how have your results been in competition(s) this week?</li>\n</ol>\nThe study suggests that 80% of the time effort level in practice/preparation will be within +/-2 on the results scale. This tells me that a person really can control success, at least 80% of the time, and the best way to do it is to focus on practice/preparation effort.\n\nSimply put, if you will make the commitment to go to practices and put great energy into preparing yourself both mentally and physically, then you are doing your best to control results. It won’t always happen, however if you are 9 or a 10 on the practice/preparation effort scale, you will put yourself in a position to increase success. Try to get in the habit of defining your success with the level of effort you put into practice/preparation, and in doing so, you will typically find yourself happier and more successful.\n\nBe sure that you are putting the preparation into your mental game as well as your physical game. If you are not doing daily mental workouts, it is definitely something you need to do be doing if you want to mentally be prepared for practices and competitions (to develop your own personalized mental workout check out chapters 1-5 in my book <strong><em>10-MinuteToughness</em></strong>).\n\nRemember being great isn’t easy, it’s not supposed to be easy, but it is your choice.

When you start with green plantains, you get crisp chips that deliver delicious flavor, quality carbs, resistant starch, and — get this — more vitamin C, vitamin A, and potassium than sweet bananas. Take that, corn!\n\nI always think of nachos as weekend food, but this recipe comes together in under an hour, so it's great for Fiesta Friday and a random Tuesday. The meat is simmered in Tex-Mex spices and packs a punch, especially if you top it with a squeeze of fresh lime juice and jalapeños. <em>Olé!</em>\n\n<strong>Plantain Nachos</strong>\nServes 2-4 | Prep 20 minutes | Cook 30 minutes\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4852\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/plantain_nachos-300x264.jpg\" alt=\"plantain_nachos\" width=\"300\" height=\"264\" /></strong>\n\n<strong>Ingredients:</strong>\n<strong> Plantains:</strong>\n2 green plantains\n1 tablespoon coconut oil, melted\n<strong>Taco Meat:</strong>\n2 teaspoons coconut oil\n1/2 medium onion, minced (about 1/2 cup)\n3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)\n2 tablespoons chili powder\n1 teaspoon ground cumin\n1 teaspoon ground coriander\n1/2 teaspoon dried oregano leaves\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n1 pound ground beef\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n1/2 cup chicken broth\n2 teaspoons cider vinegar\n\n<strong>Garnish:</strong>\nminced scallions\njalapeño slices\ndiced avocado\nshredded lettuce\nchopped tomato\nfresh lime juice\n\n<strong>Directions:</strong>\n1. Preheat oven to 350F. Cover two large baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.\n\n2. Prep the plantains. Cut off both ends of the plantain, then with the tip of a sharp knife, make shallow slits lengthwise along the skin. Use your fingers to pry off the strips. With a mandoline slicer on its thinnest setting, slice the plantains into coins. Use two wooden spoons to toss the slices in a large bowl with the melted coconut oil.\n\n3. Bake the plantains. Use four coins to make each “tortilla:” Lay them flat on the baking sheet with edges slightly overlapping and sprinkle with salt. While they bake, the natural starches make them stick together. Bake for about 30 minutes until very crisp and beginning to brown. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with additional salt, if you’re feeling it. Meanwhile…\n\n4. Make the taco meat. Heat the coconut oil in a large, non-stick skillet over medium heat, about 2 minutes. Add onion and cook until softened, about 7-10 minutes. In a small bowl, mix the garlic, chili powder, cumin, coriander, oregano, cayenne, and salt. Add to the onions and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\n\nCrumble the ground beef into the pan and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Push the meat to the side of the pan and drop in the tomato paste, frying until it darkens a bit, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth and vinegar; stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer and cook, uncovered, 10 minutes, until the liquid has reduced and thickened. Add salt and pepper, to taste.\n\n5. Dig in!

It's a grocery store, <a href=\"http://experience.usatoday.com/food-and-wine/story/best-of-food-and-wine/food/2013/07/16/great-american-bites-new-orleans-muffuletta-sandwich-central-grocery/2520935/\" target=\"_blank\">Central Grocery and Deli</a>, to be exact. The ginormous muffaletta sandwiches they churn out to tourists — piled with Italian cold cuts like ham, mortadella, salami, pepperoni, and capicola, plus provolone and Swiss cheeses — are defined by the relish they serve on top. It's the best salad to ever grace a sandwich, a salty-tangy combination of olives, celery, carrots, onions, cauliflower, hot and sweet peppers, capers, and lots of garlic.\n\nOne day, I had a hankering for a muffaletta, but bread and cheese are decidedly off my menu. Why not, I thought, just eat the best part — the salad! — and forget about the rest. And so this Muffaletta Salad was born. You can eat it on its own, or roll it up in slices of Applegate Farms salami and ham for the closest thing you can get to the Big Easy without leaving your kitchen.\n\n<strong>Muffaletta Salad</strong>\n<strong> Serves 4-6 | Prep 15 min | Cook 20 min | Whole30 compliant</strong>\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4851\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/muffaletta2-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"muffaletta2\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /></strong>\n\n<strong>Ingredients:</strong>\n1/2 head cauliflower, coarsely chopped (about 4 cups)\n2 medium carrots, chopped (about 1 cup)\n2 medium celery stalks, chopped (about 1/2 cup)\n3 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n1 anchovy fillet, minced (or 1 teaspoon anchovy paste)\n3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)\n1/2 tablespoon dried oregano leaves\n1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil\n1/3 cup pimento-stuffed green olives, chopped\n1/3 cup pitted black olives, chopped\n1 roasted red bell pepper (from a jar or freshly roasted), chopped\n1/4 cup jarred, sliced banana peppers, drained and chopped\n\n<strong>Directions:</strong>\n1. Steam the cauliflower, carrot, and celery until just tender, about 12-14 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, use a whisk or fork to mix the vinegar, anchovy, garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper until combined, then drizzle in the olive oil, whisking constantly.\n\n2. When the veggies are just the way you want them, drain excess water and add the hot vegetables to the dressing in the bowl. Toss with two wooden spoons until coated evenly. Add the olives and peppers, tossing again with the wooden spoons until combined. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if necessary. Place in a covered container in the fridge until cool, then adjust seasonings again. Serve chilled.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> This tastes even better with age. It’s delicious when you make it and mind-blowingly yummy the second and third days. Believe it. Should the leftovers last long enough for you to grow weary of eating it as a salad, heat it in a non-stick skillet, then drizzle it with a little more extra-virgin olive oil, sprinkle it with a handful of chopped parsley, and serve it as a hot side dish.","Slug":"paleo-muffaletta-salad","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/healthy_recipes/paleo-muffaletta-salad/","Path":"/healthy_recipes/paleo-muffaletta-salad/","Date":"2015-04-27","Year":"2015","Month":"04","Day":"27","Categories":"Paleo Recipes","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/paleo-muffaletta-salad.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/paleo-muffaletta-salad.jpg","Image Alt Text":"paleo muffaletta salad"},{"id":"4855","Title":"Beet Juice, Why Are More People At My Gym Drinking It?","Meta Description":"Turns out the high concentrations of nitrates found in beet juice enhance vasodilatation, improves endurance, performance, lowers blood pressure and increases...","Content":"<h1>If You Can’t “Beet” ‘Em, Join ‘Em. Why You Should Be Drinking Beet Juice...</h1>\n\n<hr />\n\nYou may have been seeing more and more talk about using beets, or more specifically, beet juice, as part of your nutritional protocol to support your training regime.\n\nGranted, it makes sense that fresh vegetables would play a role in any healthy eating plan, but what is it about beets that stand out more than other veggies?\n<h1>Health benefits of beets include:</h1>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Lowering Blood Pressure</strong></li>\n \t<li><strong>Boosting Stamina</strong></li>\n \t<li><strong>Cancer- Fighting Properties</strong></li>\n \t<li><strong>Rich in Valuable Nutrients and Fiber</strong></li>\n \t<li><strong>Anti inflammatory properties</strong></li>\n</ul>\nSounds good so far, but how does this food pertain to fueling an athlete in particular?\n<h2>It’s all down to the nitric oxide content...</h2>\nThe high concentrations of nitrates found in beet juice enhance vasodilatation, (the capacity of blood vessels to dilate, thus increased blood flow).\n\nA few years ago, researchers from Exeter University performed a study in which they recruited nine subjects and gave them either regular beetroot juice or nitrate-depleted beetroot juice to drink every day for six days.\n\nThey found that consuming regular beetroot juice increased blood nitrate levels and reduced resting blood pressure, reduced oxygen consumption during moderate- and high-intensity exercise and increased time to exhaustion at high intensity by 15 percent (which is a lot).\n<h2>But how many servings of beets are needed to achieve this?</h2>\nCan we throw one or two in the Vitamix or Blendtec juicer and meet our high-demand for these valuable nutrients?\n\nJuicing fresh beets on a daily basis is one way, but what to do if you’re traveling for a race and in a hotel? Or if you’re about to do an evening session straight after you leave the office? What if you simply don't like the earthy beet taste?\n<h2>Enter Beet Nitrates from AMRAP Nutrition...</h2>\nWith a natural ingredient label (Non-GMO Beet Juice Concentrate, Electrolyte Blend (Potassium Citrate, Sea Salt, Magnesium Oxide), Stevia, Natural Flavor), a very palatable sweet, non-earthy taste, I tested it for the first time just over a month ago and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nAs a long time Paleo endurance athlete, I want my diet to consist of as much real food (as opposed to the plethora of junk that we are inundated with in the forms of sports drinks made with corn syrup, energy bars made with gluten and soy powder and recovery drinks made with whey and sucralose), and as little manufactured product as possible.\n\nTo that end, my own training and fueling has changed considerably over the years. Back when I first began racing triathlon (and I’m dating myself now by sharing that I’m embarking on my 18<sup>th</sup> season!), I tried pretty much every product out there, from drinks to energy chews to powders to brightly colored gels.\n\nAs I learned more about <strong>why these ‘foods’ were not only not helping me</strong> dial in my training and nutrition, but preventing me from reaching the lean body weight I’d been coveting and making me sick at the same time, it became more and more evident that a change was in order, which led me to adapt to the principles of a True Paleo Regime, back in 2005.\n\nEven since then, my fueling protocol has changed considerably and I continue to test certain products that pique my interest as they arise.\n\nAlong with becoming more efficient at using fat as my fuel comes fiddling around with macro nutrient ratios, fasted training and what foods I rely on for recovery.\n\nThe bottom line for me, as well as many athlete clients with whom I work to developer their nutritional game plan, is to keep it as real as possible, as often as possible.\n\nAnd, just as with my love for AMRAP's paleo nutrition bar, similarly, there is a time and place where their <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJ6V0FC/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=amrapwebsite-20&amp;linkId=2ROBJKQFJQHUULSA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beet Nitrate formula</a> comes in handy.<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJ6V0FC/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=amrapwebsite-20&amp;linkId=2ROBJKQFJQHUULSA\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-5684 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Beet-nitrates2-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n<h2>My final thought to those wanting to achieve their health, fitness or wellness goals.</h2>\nThe message is not to eat as many bars and powders as you can, but rather to keep your eyes open for which products are introduced that are:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Actually made of real food.

But to discover exactly how much sodium you need to supplement for that volume of fluid you lose via sweat will require a very specific and unique technology operated by the world leaders in hydration consultancy: Precision Hydration.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><strong>How to determine the volume of fluid you lose while exercising?</strong></h4>\nFirst we have to figure out your sweat rates by simply replacing what you lose. The simplest way to do that is to weigh your self before, during and after training or racing and replace each 1g loss with 1ml of fluid. So, for example, 1.1 kg loss would be replaced with 1100 ml of fluid.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt is very important to notice that there is a correlation of temperature, humidity and intensity of the physical activity related to that fluid loss. So don’t be overwhelmed at the start. If you are committed enough, in the long term you will be able to get your fluid intake table at different intensities of training and temperatures.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><strong>How to determine the concentration of sodium you lose per volume of sweat?</strong></h4>\nThe methods described in the scientific literature and those currently in use involve placing patches on various parts of the body and exercising until the patches become saturated with sweat. The patch is then squeezed into a bottle and taken to the lab for analysis.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere is a new-patented technology developed by Precision Hydration that involves inducing a sample of sweat using a chemical called pilocarpine on your forearm. The test takes 20 minutes and does not involve exercising. The sweat sample is collected over a small 2 1⁄2 cm (1 inch) area on your forearm and the saltiness of your sweat analyzed to give a number that is unique to you. That specific number is the concentration of sodium you will need to supplement per volume of fluid you need to replace. Curiosity piqued? <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/35069745\" target=\"_blank\">Watch this video of the test</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe sweat analysis number is unique to you and is part of your genetic code. The number is relatively fixed although with acclimation humans tend to adapt to their surroundings. Heat acclimation in athletes has shown that with repeated exposure to heat and humidity your body will tend to reduce losses of most sweat electrolytes. There is no change with 7 hours exposure so you are unlikely to need to alter your regime even in a very long race. At 4 days exposure sweat sodium levels will drop by about 18%. By Day 10 as you fully acclimatize the drop will be around 40%. However, your sweat rate will increase by around 6%.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n<h4><strong>Recommendations</strong></h4>\n1)   Please be aware that below 1 hour of exercising you can stick to just water, since there is always a preload of sodium in your body.\n\n2)   Don’t fall into the marketing trap of the sport industry, since they have confused the hydration process with the fueling, recovery process and any other you can think of.\n\n3)   Start working on your drink personalization as you do in your nutrition, it is equally important for your performance.","Slug":"hydration-affects-performance-part-2","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/how_to/hydration-affects-performance-part-2/","Path":"/how_to/hydration-affects-performance-part-2/","Date":"2015-04-08","Year":"2015","Month":"04","Day":"08","Categories":"How To | Performance Advice","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/endurance-athletes-racing.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/endurance-athletes-racing.jpg","Image Alt Text":"endurance athletes racing"},{"id":"4872","Title":"Detox Plan That Doesn't Leave You Miserable","Meta Description":"Guilt has no business ruling your life.

Rather than beating yourself up about it, just dust yourself off and start fresh the very next day.\n\nSo if you have enjoyed one too many peanut butter and chocolate eggs over Easter weekend, here are some tips for beating the blues and feeling good about yourself a day after poor choices.\n\n<hr />\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n<h4><em>Drink plenty of water.</em></h4>\nIf you ate foods high in salt or sugar, you may feel dehydrated. Drink plenty of water the next day to avoid feeling sluggish or woozy.</li>\n\t<li>\n<h4><em>Exercise, even if you feel uncomfortable. </em></h4>\nWhen I eat the wrong foods, my body physically hurts the next day. I may have a stomachache or other body aches. Even though my mind is telling me it's the last thing I want to do, when I get up and move the day after eating unhealthy, even if it's low-impact, I feel so much better afterwards. Burning a few calories can really help ease the bloat-y feeling you may experience.</li>\n\t<li>\n<h4><em>Don't fast, but eat less than you typically do. </em></h4>\nI always feel more balanced when I eat less the day after I've eaten way more than I should have. If you repeat the cycle a second day, you'll feel even worse and it'll be that much harder to get back on track after multiple days off-plan. Eat what your body needs, but don't overeat a second day.</li>\n\t<li>\n<h4><em>Reflect on your choices, on what you did well and what you could have done better. </em></h4>\nWe all have these days, which is perfectly okay! But I find that it's beneficial to reflect on my choices, good and bad. <em>Was I eating because I was hungry, or because the food was tempting? What could I have done better? What was something that I was really proud I was able to avoid? What was something I'm grateful that I accomplished? </em>I like to reflect on my choices, because it may give me a better insight into the situation and what I could do better next time.</li>\n\t<li>\n<h4><i>Don't beat yourself up. </i></h4>\nI mean it! It's no use to sit around and wallow in what you should have, could have, or would have done if the day could somehow be repeated. Just reflect on the day in a positive way, and move on. We all make mistakes, and frankly, we all need a day where we don't hyper focus on eating healthy food. Sometimes you need a break! THAT IS OKAY. The worst thing you can do is beat yourself up over one day, especially if you've had more than one day of successful choices.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe reality is that we fumble, indulge, overeat, but I have found that as I use these tips during my post-holiday recovery, I feel better faster.

I promise.</h2>\nBack in the day, there was nothing that removed the stress of a long day at work, than to pick up the phone and order takeout. It was so soothing to eat Chinese or Thai food out of those cardboard cartons, feet propped on the coffee table with a John Hughes movie playing on the TV.\n\nBut those days are over! No more crappy takeout for me — or for you!\n\nThis pad thai recipe has the mouth-feel of the original, without the extra sugars, soy, peanuts, and rice noodles that make it a nutritional minefield. My recipe is based on already-cooked ingredients — roasted spaghetti squash, cooked chicken thighs, and creamy-nutty-irresistible <a href=\"http://theclothesmakethegirl.com/2009/07/21/sunshine-sauce/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunshine Sauce</a> made with sunflower butter — so it comes together faster than takeout if you've got the raw materials in the fridge. I recommend a cookup when you're <em>not</em> tired that includes chicken thighs, Sunshine Sauce, and spaghetti squash. That way, when you <em>are</em> tired, you can stir-fry this meal together in about 10 minutes.\n\nIf you're really in a pinch, you can substitute rotisserie chicken for the home-cooked chicken, or get creative and swap <a href=\"http://theclothesmakethegirl.com/2014/05/27/basic-zucchini-noodles/\" target=\"_blank\">zucchini noodles</a> for the spaghetti squash.

Crack the eggs into a small bowl, and use a fork to scramble them with the coconut aminos. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, about 3 minutes. Add 2 teaspoons coconut oil to the skillet, and when it’s melted, pour in the eggs and let them spread like a pancake. Reduce the heat to medium and cover with a lid, letting the eggs cook until they’re set and beginning to brown on the bottom, about 3-4 minutes. Flip and lightly brown the other side. Remove the eggs from the pan and cut into strips with a sharp knife.\n\n2. Using the same pan, increase heat to medium-high and add 1 teaspoon coconut oil to the pan. Sauté the onion and snap peas, stirring with a wooden spoon, until they’re crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Add the spaghetti squash, chicken, and cooked egg to the pan and, stirring with a wooden spoon, cook until heated through, about 3 minutes.\n\n3. Add the Sunshine Sauce to the pan and stir-fry until everything is well-blended and hot.

If you're busy these short workouts help you gain speed and become a better overall runner.","Content":"<h2>Speed and Endurance are not Mutually Exclusive. They go Together.</h2>\n<div></div>\n<div>As an obstacle course racer I get many many questions on how to improve times. And while attacking obstacles are a big part of getting through a course, it’s still a runners game out there. The biggest question I get is how many miles do I run per week? My answer is very few and this usually comes as a surprise to most people. To be completely honest I just don't have the time and most people that have a full time job don't either. If you are training for a marathon or an ultra event you would have a completely different training approach which would include some long runs, but for your typical 5-15k OCR race I don't believe you need all those miles in order to improve. So here is my philosophy on some short workouts that will help you gain speed and become a better overall runner.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n\n<hr />\n\n</div>\n<h4>Reinvent the Incline Run</h4>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000059222428_Full.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-5150 alignnone\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000059222428_Full-199x300.jpg\" alt=\"Obstacle_Course_Racers\" width=\"199\" height=\"300\" /></a></div>\n<div>My main goal during training is to make my miles count. This means that I want my training miles to be harder than my race miles will be. My three main ways of doing this are: running on hills/incline, carrying something heavy, or sprint work. I am not saying never to go for a long run but for the most part I stick to some short but intense workouts. Speed work is very important for any runner. If you want to be able to hold a faster pace for a longer distance you need to get your body used to running faster even if its for a shorter distance.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>[Tweet \"Speed work is very important for any runner. You want to hold a faster pace for a longer distance.\"]</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Eventually your body will start adjusting and be able to hold that pace longer and longer. Finding a local track or hitting treadmill for some sprint repeats is a super effective way to gain some speed. I do a variety of distances from quarter mile to full mile repeats. One example is a 10x400m repeat with 10 burpees in between because I train for obstacle course racing. Getting used to the transition of running to obstacle back to running without losing a ton of time is crucial in the sport of OCR.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n\n<hr />\n\n</div>\n<h4>Pack on the Lbs</h4>\n<div><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-5148 alignnone\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/joey-patrolia-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"joey_patrolia_ocr_athlete\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></div>\n<div>Another way to intensify your workouts is to add some weight to your runs. I try to keep my weighted runs on some sort of incline whether a local hill or atreadmill because its going to be a bit easier on the joints. If you have a sandbag or a weight vest you should use them with some hill repeats.Find a good hill that is not to long and do 5-10 repeats with the weight, or use the treadmill if you need to. <em><strong>Hill training with or without weight is very useful, but adding the weight will get you ready for your next OCR.</strong></em></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>[Tweet \"Hill training is very useful, but adding the weight will get you ready for your next OCR. \"]</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>A popular workout for incline training is the 15% 15 min challenge. This workout is done on a treadmill without using the handrails. Treadmill should be set to 15% incline and timed for 15 minutes. Goal is to get as much distance as you can handle in the 15 minutes. You control the speed throughout the 15 minutes. This is a short, very intense workout that will allow you to track progress as well.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n\n<hr />\n\n</div>\n<h4>Bottom Line</h4>\n<div>[Tweet \"You don't need a ton of time in order to improve fitness, but you do need the desire.\"]</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>So again, you don't need a ton of time in order to improve, but you do need the desire. Short intense workouts will help you get better quicker without taking up a ton of time. Don't worry so much about distance and focus more on the intensity of the workout. There are a couple of workouts in this article you can try but feel free to reach out with any questions or for some new workouts.

My family went 100% Paleo when our son was born because the \"standard diet\" was no option.","Content":"<h2>And What I Learned Raising My Son in a Non-Paleo World</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nMy wife and I have been raising our son in the Paleo lifestyle since he was born a little over three years ago. We made the decision to become a Paleo family about a year before he was born. <em><strong>It seemed like a daunting task when I thought about the all the obstacles we would face. </strong></em>  The alternative to raise him in what we will call “conventional method” just was not an option.   I am here to say that anybody can do it especially when you think about setting your child up for success. Focus on these five pieces of advice when begin your transition to a Paleo family.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>1) Set Your Kid up for Success</h4>\nI think the thing that could make it hard to raise a child Paleo is if you care what everybody thinks about you. If you already live the Paleo lifestyle for the right reasons chances are you don’t care. People will tell you need to feed your child all kinds of things like whole grains to get their nutrients. Sometimes when it comes to child you might start to doubt yourself, but stay the course.I heard this a lot. Parents told me kids just don’t want to eat veggies.   This could be true if you try to switch over a five year old who as eaten cereal and bagels their whole life. (You can still do it you just might have to try some different strategies.)\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>2) Eating Right From Birth</h4>\nFrom birth kids don’t have all the preconceived notions about food that we do. If your kids watch you eat veggies and meat then they will eat them as well. My son will eat forks full of lettuce, kale, and broccoli. Some days he will eat tons of veggies then the next day he will eat none. This is probably more like our hunter gather ancestors ate. They couldn’t just run over to the grocery store and get a cart full of veggies, fruit, or meat.\n\n<em><strong>My advice: just don’t get into the concept that your child has to finish their plate before they can get down from their seat or treat food as a reward.</strong></em>\n\nOne day my son will seem like he is eating us out of house and home and the next he barely eats anything. He knows his body better than I do and will eat when he is hungry. This works with a Paleo lifestyle when you are eating good nutritious food. On the other hand, if you were to allow processed food full of sugar this would not work. His body would not be able to control the hunger signal because the sugar has a nasty way of confusing the brain. Sugar triggers an addictive craving in the brain the same way cocaine triggers binges with a drug addict. With a poor diety, a kid would want more and more and until he was overeating. Eventually it would make him obese.\n\n<em><strong>The bottom line is this: </strong>when eating whole unprocessed food a child can figure out on their own how much they need of what. Whether that is tons of sweet potatoes one day or half pound of grass fed/finished beef another.</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><strong>3) Avoid the Attitude and Prepare for the Energy</strong></h4>\nClearly, if your body doesn't feel good, you won't feel inclined to be happy or energetic. The greatest benefit about raising my son Paleo is the way his over all general attitude is throughout the day. Yes, he is a three year old so everything is not always rosy, but when compared to other kids who eat a standard American diet, the contrast is night and day.<em><strong> My son has sustained energy all day; he doesn’t have quite the ups and downs other kids have. </strong></em>\n\nMost of this is because he doesn’t get sugar bombs in his belly from processed food and candy.   He has spent a couple of days with some relatives and friends. He may not have had exactly the diet we would have wanted for the day. His attitude when we picked him up from these outings was awful until he slept it off and got better food in his belly.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000035831766_Full.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-5142 alignnone\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000035831766_Full-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"boy_playing_with_dog\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>\n<h4>4) Find the Natural Teaching Moments</h4>\nThis happens, but recognize that it gives us parents a great teaching moment. We got to show him how certain foods make him feel--some feel good and some feel bad. One time my son had some gluten free bread at a friend’s house. When we got home he was complaining about his stomach hurting. I mentioned to him about how we don’t eat bread because it make our stomachs hurt. Now when he sees bread he will mention not to eat it because of what it does to our stomachs. Keeping a toddler somewhat even keeled throughout the day is always a plus for me. (My son runs around all day and has no off switch so keeping that in a positive direction is good for everybody. You can probably relate.)\n\nCooking is another great way to get your child involved and learn about the food they are eating. My son has his own knife and other utensils to help us with prep work. It is child knife that will cut through things but will not cut through his skin. <em><strong>He gets excited to help us with cooking. He also enjoys eating it more when he knows he helped make it.</strong></em> This is great when he is young, but will have greater pay offs once he is older. He will be able to help us cook and make his own nutritious meals when he gets out on his own. Basically it all boils down to trying to set him up with skills to lead a very healthy life.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>5) Take Time to Reflect</h4>\nIt has been a great three years raising him so far. Maintaining Paleo is an easier part of our daily routine. It is been hard but a little planning goes a long way. For example, we have had to pack coolers of food to take with us on trips so we knew we would be eating good food. Everything will not always go exactly as you want but keep working and do not give up. We are talking about setting up your child on the right path for life. People will tell me, “You can’t do it without living in a bubble,” or “You don’t have enough time.” The reality is, we make time if it is important, and if you are consistent in your Paleo lifestyle, others will accept it (most of the time).\n\nI do extra work because I owe my son a better life. If I can show people it can be done, hopefully they will find the willpower to beef up their nutrition. In our small and meaningful way, parents have the power to turn around child health in America. I promise you can do it. Now just get to it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;","Slug":"became-paleo-dad","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/nutrition_hacks/became-paleo-dad/","Path":"/nutrition_hacks/became-paleo-dad/","Date":"2015-05-06","Year":"2015","Month":"05","Day":"06","Categories":"Lifestyle Design | Nutrition Hacks","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/growing_boy_dinosaur.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000057880380_Full.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000035831766_Full.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/growing_boy_dinosaur.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000057880380_Full.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000035831766_Full.jpg","Image Alt Text":"growing_boy_dinosaur_measure | boy_playing_with_dog"},{"id":"5100","Title":"20 Minute Paleo Recipes for Morning, Noon, and Night","Meta Description":"These 20 minute paleo recipes are the best tasting staples in my life.

We’ll explain why and how AMRAP bars are uniquely created with high-intensity athletes in mind.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Why Focus Mainly on CrossFit?</span></strong>\n\nCross functional training is crucial for all athletes—runners need to lift weights, and weighlifters benefit from yoga practice. To this end, CrossFit is creating a tidal wave affect with their educated viral workout principles. It focuses on teaching the theories and methodologies that are producing some of the fittest people in the world.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAthletes love CrossFit’s amazing methods that not only change your body, but your life as well. From the physical results, improved health, and the passion and camaraderie shared among fellow CrossFitters, it is a training regimen that pushes athletes to be the best version of themselves.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe love the CrossFit community because it brings together a diverse group of discerning athletes seeking optimal and healthy performance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are certainly arguments against the training style, but the industry has demonstrated tremendous progress in the United States and internationally.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>In 2005, 13 gyms were open. In 2014, 7,000 affiliate gyms operate.</li>\n\t<li>The CrossFit Games have a 166% year over year growth rate.</li>\n\t<li>The estimated failure rate of opening a CrossFit gym is 2%</li>\n\t<li>2 Billion is the estimated net of just the CrossFit affiliates in 2013</li>\n\t<li>CrossFit has taken the lead with consumer searches on Google while other big name brand gyms have remained relatively flat-lined.</li>\n</ul>\n(Reference:<em> By the Numbers: The Growth of CrossFit</em> (channelsignal.com))\n\n&nbsp;\n\nClearly with that much development and newfound focus on high-caliber training, responsible nutrition is in high demand.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAMRAP Nutrition arose from CrossFit athletes looking to replace toxic supplements with a clean appetizing energy bar. The AMRAP Bar (100% Paleo) was born from the vision of athletes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Is the AMRAP Bar Ideal for Other Athletes?</span></strong>\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that CrossFit was originally started as supplemental training to enhance your overall fitness performance. It is not meant to take the place of your sport or recreational activities. Instead, you can use CrossFit to enhance your performance through improved strength, stamina, and endurance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAMRAP Nutrition designed their bars with cutting-edge Crossfitters in mind, based on the fundamental principle that CrossFit is used by a broad spectrum of athletes looking for solutions to their fitness shortcomings. From that standpoint, multi-sport athletes will manifest the performance benefits of these bars.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Should You Eat It?</span></strong>\n\nAside from CrossFitters, AMRAP bars are a highly effective source of energy for other intense athletics. If you are a:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Runner</li>\n\t<li>Cyclist</li>\n\t<li>Skiier</li>\n\t<li>Mountaineer</li>\n\t<li>Climber</li>\n\t<li>Surfer</li>\n\t<li>Martial Artist</li>\n\t<li>Dancer</li>\n</ul>\nThese bar will enhance your performance the same way it elevates the CrossFit athletes that swear by them. They provide athletes with the whole ingredients, unprocessed nutrients, and clean fuel to power their workouts.","Slug":"who-are-amrap-bars-designed-for","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/?p=5123","Path":"/?p=5123","Date":"-111-30-30","Year":"-111","Month":"30","Day":"30","Categories":"Interesting Other"},{"id":"5124","Title":"Where your food comes from matters...now more than ever.","Content":"<strong>AMRAP Nutrition Vision and Values</strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\nIt’s important to know where you buy your food.

Now, after a lot of work; I can proudly say that I call myself an athlete, I have never been dedicated to the idea of relying on supplements to fuel and enhance my activity. Whether it be for pre-, during, or post-workout, I just have not seen enough benefit of supplements. As a woman, my nutrition needs are not always addressed by a supplement product, aside from an occasional protein powder and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009S953YC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455125421&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=paleo+bars&amp;m=&amp;tag=a0140b74-20\" target=\"_blank\">beloved paleo nutrition bars</a>.\n\nMost supplements do not interest me. Social media is ablaze with supplements toting increased energy, muscle recovery, and growth, and I only vaguely care. At one point, I found myself researching some of these supplements just to see what all the hype was about. I came across warnings such as, \"do not consume with coffee\" and \"may cause a tingling sensation.\"\n\nYikes! I immediately vowed to not try these supplements because they clearly came with some heavy side effects. Not cool.\n\nThat is, until recently when I began hearing more chatter around the benefits of nitrate rich beet powder. After some reading and searching, I tried <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJ6V0FC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455125568&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Beet+Nitrates&amp;m=&amp;tag=a0140b74-20\" target=\"_blank\">Beet Nitrates</a> from AMRAP.\n\nAMRAP's Beet Nitrate formula is freeze dried beetroot powder that, when mixed with water, can be used as an plant-based, Paleo-friendly, pre-workout drink. It is an endurance juice with simple easy-to-digest ingredients. There is nothing scary about this formula; beets, sea-salt, and stevia, and the payoff is big.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1> Why beets, you ask?</h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000039800446_Full.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5188\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000039800446_Full-300x240.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh  juices - red beet, cabbage and carrot\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" /></a>Since beets are rich in Nitrates (NO3), the mix becomes absorbed into the bloodstream and is secreted into saliva. The bacteria in your mouth converts the Nitrates into Nitrite (NO2). When the NO2-rich saliva gets swallowed, the Nitrite is re-absorbed and loses oxygen to become Nitric Oxide (NO). The NO then boosts your stamina, which helps you exercise for an extended period of time and also improves blood flow and pressure. I've found that AMRAP's Beet Formula allows you to work out to your greatest potential.\n\nI have used AMRAP Beet Nitrates now a few times. I have used it prior to performing a variety of exercises, such as Zumba, power lifting, and running. <strong>The greatest success that I found with using it has been that it has increased my endurance.</strong> Some of my workouts can last as long as two hours depending on the day of the week and the part of the body I am targeting that day, so energy boost I gain from a healthy beet juice is insanely helpful.\n\nWith this energy increase, I have also found that I am able to endure longer workouts, which has motivated me to increase my workout time. Even though I haven't seen an improvement in, say, my running time in the short term, it certainly makes for an easier and more effective workout.\n\nI would highly recommend the Beet Nitrate formula from AMRAP Nutrition for any athlete that is looking for a safe, plant-based alternative to a traditional pre-workouts or endurance powders. It is made by people I trust, and who have my best interests at heart because they use beet juice in the same way.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1>My Favorite Features</h1>\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Image-2_13.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-5555  alignright\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Image-2_13-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"262\" height=\"262\" /></a></h1>\n<ul>\n\t<li>All my friends can say a brief prayer to the gods in the sky - as nasty as a instant beet juice sounds, it actually taste really good; it's sweet and not earthy like you would think.</li>\n\t<li>It only takes 20 - 30 minutes to kick in and the benefits last upwards of 4 or more hours.

Performance gains achieved by getting into a sauna are far safer and superior to common methods.","Content":"<h2>High Performers Integrate Sauna For Marked Results</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nSport performance comes from consistency and adaptation capabilities. Consistency is the discipline, dedication and repetitiveness to achieve a desired goal. Adaptation capability will be correlated to physiological and psychological factors. On the physiological side there are different methods to enhance sport performance, from periodization protocols to high-altitude training. On the same lines, the sauna method is as a simple-proved sport performance enhancer.\n\n[Tweet \"Consistency is the discipline, dedication and repetitiveness to achieve a desired goal.\"]\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>The Science of Sauna Thermotherapy</h3>\n<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000005919951_Large.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5202\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000005919951_Large-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Interior of a Finnish sauna\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>\n\nTolerance to heat exhaustion is one of those performance capabilities an athlete should have in their repertoire. Temperature is affecting our body in multiple unique ways, so it is important to understand how the temperature process occurs in our body. As well, blood plays a crucial roll in sport performance and is strictly related to temperature changes, so we will dig in that as well.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Thermotherapy</strong> entails various techniques like sauna, steam baths, infrared lamps and warm water immersion. It is believed that these methods can increase subcutaneous and cutaneous blood flow as a result of an increase in cardiac output and a lower peripheral resistance. This increase in blood flow increases cellular, lymphatic, and capillary permeability, which can increase metabolism, nutrient delivery, and waste removal from the cells. Much anecdotal and practical information can be found about the proposed benefits of thermotherapy, but still little scientific research exploring its use as a recovery-performance enhancer tool is available (Bompa &amp; Haff, 2009).\n\n[Tweet \"Increasing your core temperature for short periods may offer dramatic athletic performance improvements. \"]\n\nAccording to Ph.D. Rhonda Perciavalle Patrick, increasing the core temperature for short periods, as is done by using a sauna, may offer dramatic improvements to athletic performance. Emerging research suggests that this hyperthermic conditioning has multiple positive effects on your body, from increased endurance to the growth of new brain cells.\n\nThis video breaks down the science of thermotherapy for athletes:\n\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHOlM-wlNjM[/embed]\n\nTemperature in the body occurs through the process of radiation, conduction, convection and evaporation. The most important of this heat removal process for the performance athlete is the evaporation of sweat (75%), which releases 580 kcal per liter of sweat evaporated in the skin. While as humans we are well evolved to perform strength, aerobic and endurance exercise, our high sweat rates mean that water is removed from our body at high ratio, and must therefore be replaced at appropriate proportion. Prolonged stay in a sauna may lead to the loss of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte\">electrolytes</a> from the body, as after vigorous exercise. The risk of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration\">dehydration</a> leading to heat stroke may be reduced by proper hydration. Read about easy hydration in my recent posts: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a title=\"How Hydration Affects Performance – Part 1\" href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/hydration-affects-performance-part-1/\">part 1 </a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">and</span> <a title=\"How Hydration Affects Performance – Part 2\" href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/how_to/hydration-affects-performance-part-2/\">part 2</a></span>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Physiologic adaptations that occur from hyperthermic conditioning include:</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Improved cardiovascular mechanisms: lower heart rate (Hannuksela &amp; Ellahham, 2001)</li>\n\t<li>Higher sweat rate (Costa, Moore &amp; Walsh, 2011)</li>\n\t<li>Increased blood flow to skeletal muscle (Costa, Moore, et. al, 2011)</li>\n\t<li>Reduced rate of glycogen depletion (King, Costill, Fink, et. al, 1985)</li>\n\t<li>Increased red blood cell count (Scoon, Hoopkins, et. al, 2007)</li>\n\t<li>Increased efficiency of oxygen transport to muscles (Scoon, Hoopkins, et. al, 2007)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nResearch done by University of Otago in New Zealand, found that sauna bathing increased run time to exhaustion by 32%, which is equivalent to an enhancement of approximately 1.9% in an endurance time trial. Plasma and red-cell volumes increased by 7.1% and 3.5% respectively, after sauna relative to control. Change in performance had high correlations with change in plasma volume and total blood volume. So for a period of three weeks of post-exercise sauna bathing produced a worthwhile enhancement of endurance running performance, probably by increasing blood volume (Scoon, Hoopkins, et. al, 2007).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe indicated performance gains achieved just by getting into a sauna are far safer and superior to many other methods and practices common in elite sports. So from a cost-effective approach I would advise you to give it a try for a couple of months and measure any performance changes as a result of it.\n\n[Tweet \"Performance gains achieved just by getting into a sauna are far safer and superior to common practices in elite sports.\"]\n\nSauna should be integrated as part of your regular high performance lifestyle, as you do with post-workout nutrition, foam-rolling or stretching protocols. Included on a regular basis, sauna could become just another performance enhancer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>My suggested protocol to start your sauna training and integrate it to your daily life:</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Base line:</strong> Start with 10 minutes of infrared sauna (60-80ºC, 5-15% humidity) two times a week. Include this two sauna sessions right after your hardest trainings.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Keep hydrated during training, during sauna and after training &amp; sauna. (My articles on hydration cover this in <a title=\"How Hydration Affects Performance – Part 1\" href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/hydration-affects-performance-part-1/\">Part 1</a> and <a title=\"How Hydration Affects Performance – Part 2\" href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/how_to/hydration-affects-performance-part-2/\">Part 2</a>.)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Increase of time and volume:</strong> Every week add 5 min to your two times a week sauna session until you reach 30 minutes. Note: I f you still feel really hard to move-up in time, stay another week with the same time of the previous week (up to 3 consecutive weeks).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Achieve performance:</strong> Once you have got to 2 times a week 30 min sauna sessions, add a third one. Remember try to perform them just after really hard training sessions!</li>\n\t<li><strong>Maintain performance:</strong> Get 2-3 times a week of infrared sauna (60-80ºC, 5-15% humidity) as part of your routine</li>\n\t<li><strong>Racing week, tapering or competition:</strong> Cut back to 1 session per week 2 weeks prior to your competition or race. And avoid any sauna 7 days prior to your race or competition.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Pro Tips to Play By</h3>\nRemember that playing with body core temperature should be strictly correlated with hydration; otherwise sauna can play against you if you are not properly hydrated before, during and after the sauna sessions. Also be aware that you will take the best out of a sauna session with consistency and remember that it is always better if you go to sauna immediately after an exhaustive training session.\n\n[Tweet \"Thermotherapy will play against your athletic performance gains if you do not hydrate properly.  #ProTip\"]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>References:</h4>\nBompa, T. &amp; Haff, G., <em>Periodization: Theory and Methodology of Training</em>, Human Kinetics, 321, (2009)\n\nHannuksela, M.

What I have come to find throughout my many years in this world of fitness and nutrition as a CrossFit trainer and Certified Nutrition Consultant is that setting unrealistic goals and removing all enjoyment from your life just to achieve them simply will not work long term. Long term success comes from enjoying what you are doing, what you are eating, and how you feel from the inside out (this also includes loving yourself for who you are NOW). So what does this mean? Well, it means that whether you are building your fitness or creating meals to fuel you, the process HAS to be an enjoyable one. It’s simply not worth looking a certain way or reaching a fitness goal if you don’t enjoy the ride.\n\nSo, whatever fitness routine you choose, make sure it’s one you love: Group CrossFit classes can be a blast. Maybe you’re an outdoors type, and nothing beats a hike in the woods. Or maybe dancing, swinging, or climbing trees is more your style. In any case, though, make sure you move daily and that you enjoy every minute.\n\nThe same can be said for what you eat too. NO ONE can live a life of chicken breast, broccoli, and coconut oil without missing out on fun (and also some essential nutrients). That meal is boring, and YOU aren’t. Your food needs to be just as nutritious and enjoyable as your workout regime, and that is why I am here to share with you a recipe that is simple to make, and oh so delicious. Follow up a day of moving with a quality meal, and you are set up for success – not only today, but for the long haul too.\n\n[Tweet \"NO ONE can live a life of chicken, broccoli, and coconut oil.

YOU aren’t. \"]\n\nTake me for instance; nothing makes me happier than getting outside to <a href=\"http://myradicalroots.com/how-do-you-play/\">play </a>and explore in nature with my friends, family, and pups. And after a long day of moving, exploring, and playing (while getting my fitness in too), there’s no better meal to satisfy hunger and refuel than some deliciously crispy roasted chicken paired with some simple and delicious veggies. And after months of weekly trips to farmers market to buy LOTS of leg, wing, and thigh packs of pastured chicken from our favorite farmers at farmers market, AND after tons of work trying to perfect this recipe, I've finally done it. And today, I'm happy to share this recipe with all of you!\n\nSo without further ado, I bring to you my finger lickin' crispy roasted chicken. The trick is to get as much moisture as possible off the bird before cooking. Then once it's nice and salty and dry, you smother the bird with a layer of the perfect fat blend. And to really knock it out of the part, you cook it just right, at the perfect temperature with a broil to finish.\n\n<em><strong>The result is the crispiest, most delicious salty, bacon fatty chicken skin that hugs the juiciest, most flavorful dark meat chicken ever. Yum!</strong></em>\n\nI HIGHLY recommend going with pastured chicken here. The dark meat will have much higher nutrient density, much more flavor, and nothing beats buying and eating happy chickens from the farmers that make it their life's mission to farm and sell sustainably. (Just do not go Foster Farms).\n\nThis is NOT your average chicken, folks. It’s flavorful, juicy, and crispy to the very last bite. So throw your boring boneless, skinless, and nutrient-less chicken breasts away, and give this recipe a spin. Get your health journey off to a good start today OR continue on your current one. Go outside, move, play, and roast up some of this finger lickin' good chicken. You can't go wrong!\n\n[Tweet \"Go outside, move, play, and roast up some of finger lickin' good chicken.

This guide to happiness considers four elements that keep CrossFit fun and rewarding over time.","Content":"<h2>4 Elements That Keep CrossFit Fun and Rewarding with Time</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nI have been thinking and reading a lot this year about nutrition, programming, injury, and competing. After a lot of reflection and discussion with those I trust, here's some guiding advice to what will make you a happier athlete for the rest of 2015.\n<div>Each of the elements I am covering will always begin with two questions.</div>\n<ul>\n\t<li>What do you want?</li>\n\t<li>What is unique about you that requires consideration?</li>\n</ul>\n<div>These two questions are often overlooked, particularly by those writing as experts. In order to show clear expertise and that they \"figured it out\", there are no questions to be asked, only the final answers. Always ask these two questions.</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Nutrition</h3>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cheryl1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5195\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cheryl1-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"crossfit_masters_female_athlete\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></div>\n<div>When it comes to what you put in your body, these initial questions are very critical. If you want to enjoy eating all kinds of food, not be glued 100% to an official diet, or you have a very tough time eating meat, this drives your decisions. You can see where I am going with this. Know basic facts about your eating and lifestyle preferences.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>That being said, whether you want to hear it or not, a diet focused mainly on vegetables and fruits is hard to argue against. There is so much evidence around our system's difficulty digesting meat and breads over time that are impossible to deny any more. You need to start listening to the basic science of your body.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Here is the challenge with this:</strong> eating enough calories to support muscle growth and energy production through fruits and vegetables is really difficult and often expensive enough and time consuming enough to make it a non-option.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>My short recommendation:</strong> focus on slowly moving meats and keep starchy carbs to a minimum in your weekly routine. Work to find a good, clean supplement/bar/shake to help you get what you need hit your calorie numbers so you don't walk around feeling hungry all day. To go ultra strict, eliminate snack foods completely from your routine. They are often overprocessed.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>[Tweet \"Find a good clean supplement to help hit your daily calorie numbers each day so you don't feel hungry all day.\"]</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Programming</h3>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/mastersathlete.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5196\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/mastersathlete-300x155.jpg\" alt=\"masters_CrossFit_athlete\" width=\"300\" height=\"155\" /></a>This topic rests a lot on what you want, what your performance goals are. Even I have had a difficult time answering this question since I started CrossFit three years ago. I think I am finally able to a better answer for myself and this will change my training programming in a noticeable way.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>My considerations</strong> are a formerly broken back, a left big toe that has very little range-of-motion anymore, and some neck/shoulder nerve tweaking. What I really want is to better balance my flexibility and strength, then dedicate more effort to competing this year. <strong>Ask yourself: What do you really want to achieve? What do you have to consider about yourself and work around?</strong></div>\n<div><strong> </strong></div>\n<div>You have to understand that programming is not something you should be borrowing, or sampling temporarily. That might be okay while you are still testing different approaches, but ultimately you are on a program or you're not. You don't \"try the invictus workouts\" for a couple of months while also throwing in your local box workouts here and there. That is not effective. It will not work.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>If your priority is being fit so you can do anything, any day, for random amounts of time, there is nothing wrong with that. Only understand that this type of training will not be the best for you. It will be good, but not the best. Most likely if you compete and this is how you train, you may have consistent issues moving higher in the ranks as a CrossFit Masters athlete.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Know that constantly varied workouts have a SINGLE purpose within the workout and a SINGLE purpose across workouts.</strong> Within the workout, it keeps intensity high. If you are static and perform squats all day, then your level of intensity cannot stay high. Across workouts it eliminates isolation and repetition that inevitably occurs around 8-9 weeks. Isolation and repetition can create overuse and increase injury. It also would show you a plateau in performance as another undesirable outcome.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>This is controversial advice, but I will say it anyway: You want someone who understands exercise physiology (not just a CrossFit coach) to do programming for you. There are many things to be done this year and committing to a programming strategy will be the structure and incentive to get you what you want.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Recognize that you need to get training in (6-8 days) every two weeks on all three energy systems. If it has been two weeks since you hit the long, aerobic system 6-8 times (which happens in CrossFit) you need to fix the void. Running a mile, a 5k, or rowing similar distances is a good fix. With my bad foot, rowing and airdyne are best for me.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3><strong>Injury</strong></h3>\n</div>\n<div><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5197\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Games2012_MastersFinal_Rotator-300x155.jpg\" alt=\"Games2012_MastersFinal_Rotator\" width=\"300\" height=\"155\" />What injuries have you sustained and now surround with strength and flexibility training? What do you want? To be fit only or to compete? There is no right answer, just identify your considerations and choose your goal.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>I've been working on my back recovery since my first CrossFit workout. It has been very tough to get where I am, but I am proud of the goals I have achieved:</div>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Squatting heavy weights</li>\n\t<li>Increasing squat mobility (below parallel within 15 minutes after warming up!)</li>\n\t<li>Training regularly <a>at 5:30am </a></li>\n</ul>\nThrough every miniature goal, I have been healing my back. I've been surrounding it with strength and flexibility. And now it is slowly feeling more and more normal.\n<div></div>\n<div>Now that I'm turning my focus to not only competing but also to more flexibility, I'm also coming to my own unique conclusion about myself and my relationship with injury. I would normally accept injury at a higher rate if this year I wanted to compete and that's it. Though, with flexibility becoming an equal priority, I will definitely back out of a 90%+ attempt in my weightlifting if I don't feel extremely good that day. <strong>Feel it out for yourself, like I have done.</strong></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Injuries are nearly inevitable in some form. That doesn't mean that one day you'll go down in a heap with your leg buckling under you. What it means is this: to improve your fitness, you will need to cross over your limits on a weekly basis. If you cross too much you might strain something, hurt something. If you push it way over the line, you'll rip something, and require yourself to heal over many weeks.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>It is all about body awareness and I have bad news. After all my years in sports--as an athlete, coaching, and now in CrossFit--the verdict is in. Body awareness is a talent that can only be taught to a certain level of fitness. You know that guy that always gets hurt. That one that constantly rips their hands. That girl that looked like she was being electrocuted when she got her deadlift PR and has been out of commission on and off for the past 3 months since.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>[Tweet \"Body awareness is a talent that can only be taught to a certain level of fitness.\"]</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Those people are not good at gauging when they should back off, slow down or simply say \"that's good. I'm done today\". Work on this as best you can. As a 41 year old I do this often. I push myself when I can and slow down, lower the weight, or hang up the bar if my body is feeling off.</div>\n<div></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Competing</h3>\n<div><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5198\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Games2012_LitsheimRegionals_Floater2-300x212.jpg\" alt=\"Games2012_LitsheimRegionals_Floater2\" width=\"300\" height=\"212\" />There is a really great satisfaction about competing in CrossFit. You are doing it every day anyway!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>The great news:</strong> The way your mind and body interact in your competition will be nearly identical to your daily WODs (if you're doing it right). So if you haven't competed, or haven't done very many serious ones, take my word for it: you are more ready than most any other athlete to compete.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Again, you will want to consider your lifestyle and what you want here as well. For example, imagine my goal is: \"I would like to do a summer and fall comp this year. And I want to work toward those with my programming. They do not need to be big comps, they just need to be local for convenience.\" Your goal may be similar or very different from mine, so ask yourself:</div>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Do I want to compete?</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>To what scale do I want to compete?</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>What events will I sign up for?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div><strong>Your story will drive how you handle your schedule this year.</strong></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Also, find a way to practice a competition as well because there are subtle activities happening in competitions that are not happening in your daily routine. Example: You are told to get to your two-rep max on overhead squats in 6 min. So look at your weights laying in piles next to your bar.  You are thinking, \"Well I would do 45s then a 10... Oh wait, there is no 45. There is two 25s? Wait.. '3-2-1 go!'\"</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>It has happened to us all in a competition. Quick math and quick strategy take practice. The CrossFit group I run does these practices. It can be eye opening, though usually after-the-fact, so you'll want to go through experiences a few times.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n\n<hr />\n\n[Tweet \"My nutrition choices are strongly connected to my programming and my competition goals.\"]\n\n</div>\n<div>Clearly these 4 elements interact as well. My nutrition choices are strongly connected to my programming and my competition goals. Just remember to truly take some time to consider what is unique about you and what you really want out of this year. Go get it!</div>","Slug":"crossfit-masters-athletes-guide-happiness","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/crossfit-masters-athletes-guide-happiness/","Path":"/interesting_other/crossfit-masters-athletes-guide-happiness/","Date":"2015-05-26","Year":"2015","Month":"05","Day":"26","Categories":"Everything CrossFit | Interesting Other | Nutrition Hacks | Performance Advice","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CrossFit_Masters_Athletes_Men.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Games2012_LitsheimRegionals_Floater2.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Games2012_MastersFinal_Rotator.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/mastersathlete.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cheryl1.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CrossFit_Masters_Athletes_Men.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Games2012_LitsheimRegionals_Floater2.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Games2012_MastersFinal_Rotator.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/mastersathlete.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cheryl1.jpg","Image Alt Text":"CrossFit_Masters_Athletes_Men | Games2012_LitsheimRegionals_Floater2crossfit_masters_female_athlete"},{"id":"5165","Title":"Redefine Your Fitness Limits","Meta Description":"Ever been injured?

Hundreds of CrossFit events take place every year, but we have not seen anything quite like The Agoge Challenge. It is addressing the needs of injured athletes and veterans to a scale and magnitude that no other gym or event is within the states.\n\nRead the Q&amp;A with Aaron. Limited by injury or not, you will be asking “where do I sign up?”\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3><strong>Q: What is the Agoge Challenge?</strong></h3>\nA: The Agoge Challenge is a competitive fitness competition formed by military veterans, health care professionals, and strength and conditioning coaches that highlight the resiliency of the human spirit through our athletes. We promote healing, camaraderie, and instill the idea in the community that “the only limits in life are the ones we place on ourselves.” It takes place in Bedford, Texas, with plans to scale in the future.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3><strong>Q: What do you teach your participants?</strong></h3>\nA: There are four main philosophies to this competition that impact both the participants and the audience. They are:\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>“Push the body to fight or flight mode”</strong></li>\n</ol>\nWhen pushed to the brink of exhaustion the human response is to run or fight. With The Agoge Challenge, we teach everyone to be a fighter. Fight through those breaking points and walk out a more confident, healthy, and happy person. In the end it is not about who finishes where on the podium, but more about finishing.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n\t<li><strong>“Team building”<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5233\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/agoge-coaches-300x232.jpg\" alt=\"the-agoge-challenge-coaches\" width=\"300\" height=\"232\" /></strong></li>\n</ol>\nAthletes endure three demanding W.O.D.s (Workouts of the Day) each designed with a high amount of repetition designed to make our teams division work together in order to finish.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong>“Shared Hardship”</strong></li>\n</ol>\nShared hardship is a concept our veterans in the staff have learned from military service form bonds that last a lifetime. Implementing this philosophy has done exactly that for last years competitors who have not only grown close to our staff but most importantly each other.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li><strong>“Create Community”</strong></li>\n</ol>\nThe Agoge Challenge believes in rewarding our competitors for their hard work with a Warriors Feast, which is held at a select location after the competition. Awards are presented, food and live music is available for the participants and families get to share in the experience by supporting their loved one as they make new friends and connect with those who have faced similar struggles.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3><strong>Q: What type of athletes participate in this and why?</strong></h3>\nA: Everyone from able-bodied athletes competing in teams all the way to individual adaptive athletes compete. I believe that there are numerous reasons athletes compete.\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Veterans</strong>: to reconnect with a different community outside the military and to honor their fallen friends. Both able-bodied and adaptive athletes do this.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Athletes</strong> in the adaptive category compete for reasons, but the most pronounced reason is that our event gives them the chance to show the world that people are capable of more than they are given credit for. It is inspiring for themselves and others in a similar situation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>New-comers</strong> come to push their current limits. We help them establish higher capacities beyond old breaking points.</li>\n\t<li><strong>All </strong>come for the community and camaraderie that is built through shared challenges at this event.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Q: <strong>What are the top 3 benefits you hope athletes gain from the event?</strong></h3>\nA: I hope that we can teach the teams to work together. We want to introduce new people--both able-bodied and adaptive--to CrossFit. <strong>I hope it humbles people to not make excuses for why they can’t reach their goals both physically and in life</strong>. We share some hardships that service members endure through training by incorporating it in the programming, mainly through the team building concepts for able bodied athletes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Q: <strong>What is unique about this competition from other CrossFit events?</strong></h3>\nA: <strong>We highlight the resiliency of the human spirit through our adaptive athletes competing.</strong> In most competitions the adaptive athletes are a part of the competition. We make them the focus of ours. We do this through promoting them as the main focus and offering the biggest cash prizes for them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3><strong>Q: How is this event helping veterans?</strong></h3>\nA: We use the event to make service members transition to civilian life easier by introducing them to a new community. The community aspect allows the veteran to decompress through new challenges.\n\nWe allow alternative therapy organizations for veterans to set up at our event. This allows for the veteran to look into these options between WODs. We have also encouraged vet friendly companies to come out to the Agoge Challenge to schedule job interviews.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Q: <strong>Explain what adaptive training is?</strong></h3>\nA: <a href=\"http://www.fullcatabolic.com/about-us.html\">Miles Knupp</a>, our Head of Programming, will take this one.\n\nMiles: \"Adaptive training is a safe approach to high intensity functional movement with a creative mind. <strong>We strive to exert these athletes nearly to their breaking point<em>, but with a plan</em></strong>. It can be a challenge to program a workout for this type of athlete without damaging components of their body that they need for daily tasks. Our workouts have a large range of variety and complexity. For example, if an upper extremity athlete performs too much overhead movement, he/she can fatigue or injure their rotator cuff thus causing serious side effects in their ability to execute things as easily as brushing their teeth. An upper extremity cannot simply use another limb to complete a task unless they can replicate the missing limb with a prosthetic. Even in the event of a lower extremity athlete if we greatly fatigue one support limb we could easily make them a fall risk.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3><strong>Q: Is adaptive training only for injured veterans? Who else might benefit?</strong></h3>\nA: No ma’m. Everyone fights their own battles in this world. Whether they are on a battle field or in everyday life. There are people out there who may have lost a limb or the ability to walk from a horrific accident in life, but there are those who may have been born with a impairment that enjoy this type of training.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3><strong>Q: How is the Agoge Challenge spreading the impact of adaptive training to other gyms?</strong></h3>\nA: We at The Agoge Challenge spread the impact of adaptive training by raising awareness at the competition for these incredible athletes and encourage other facilities to become educated about how to train these athletes and include them in their facility.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3><strong>Q: What does an adaptive workout look?</strong></h3>\nA: In terms of intensity an adaptive workout will look no different to the untrained eye. This workout will not only include prosthetic application in several of the movements but it will be modified to allow the competing athlete to perform at a level equal to or greater than an able bodied athlete. The range of movement required may be different in degree especially from the area of the missing limb.\n\n[Tweet \"In terms of intensity, an adaptive workout will look no different to the untrained eye. \"]\n\nAn example could be an athlete that is a lower extremity may still perform squats like an able bodied athlete. He or she may use a box to limit the depth of the squat so that they do not fall over in an attempt to get the required depth. Not only could stops like the box be implemented, but similar or more simple movements could demand the same effort without a range of motion restriction. Like a one legged step up or short range pistol.\n\nI am proud to plainly see that these adaptive athletes tend to have more horse power than the average athlete because their bodies operate at a higher capacity to make up for the adaptation.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3><strong>Q: Agoge athletes--What are their strengths, limitations, background?</strong></h3>\nA: Our highlighted athletes paint this picture best, starting from newer athletes in the sport to more seasoned athletes.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/01/30/body-builder-one-arm-luke-ericson_n_6577484.html\" target=\"_blank\">Luke Ericson</a></strong>\n\nLuke got his start in CrossFit competitions with us at The Agoge Challenge last year. His mom called last minute and asked if he could register. When I first met Luke, he acted shy, timid, and nervous because he had never done anything like this. I asked him “Hey luke, what about you is adaptive brother?” He told me and we talked, laughed and built a good rapport over the phone. Luke's impairment is that he was born without the majority of his upper left body including his arm. He has an underdeveloped lung on the left side as well as organs open to injury because there is no protection provided by the limbs presence. All this means to us at The Agoge Challenge is he has twice the heart of your average competitor because the workout takes a toll<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/crossfitter-guys-in-texas.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5235\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/crossfitter-guys-in-texas-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Agoge-challenge-athletes-in-texas\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> 10 fold on his body.\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://instagram.com/derick_carver/\" target=\"_blank\">Captain Derrick Carver</a> (Retired)</strong>\n\nIn early 2010, Derrick was serving as a Platoon leader in the 82<sup>nd</sup> Airborne when he lost his leg in combat. Although he flat lined three times, endured 47 surgeries, and would need 52 blood transfusions he survived. He has since been medically retired as a Captain, opened his first CrossFit facility and they are in their second year and going strong. He has competed at Working wounded Games, WODapalooza (overall adaptive winner). As the captain of the adaptive team that competes head to head against non-adaptive teams (Team Some Assembly Required), he strives to impact his community everyday through the life he lives helping others like himself. His goal is to re build confidence and strengthen their support network through the community fitness events such as The Agoge Challenge.\n\nAs for limitations, we don’t believe in limitations at The Agoge Challenge so you will never hear us speak of limitations when it comes to our athletes who compete. If there is an obstacle for the athlete they have not mastered yet then we put it on a list or wall and encourage them to train for the goal and come back and face it head on.\n\n[Tweet \"We don't believe in limits, only opportunity for work arounds. #TheAgogeChallenge\"]\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3><strong>Q: You have celebrity support don't you?</strong></h3>\nA: Our sponsors support us because they believe in improving the overrall quality of life for those that want to enjoy everything that able bodied persons do. For celebrities backing our cause I can think of no better place to start than with the ones who have actually come onboard our staff this year.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Talon Smith</strong>- <em>Actor, Model and Programmer for the Agoge Challenge Team divisions</em>\n\n“The Agoge Challenge is an event that celebrities could easily get behind simply because it is a true American event. This event is showcases the determination and resilience of America in my opinion, because a lot of the athletes participating are veterans who were wounded in combat. If not wounded in combat, these adaptive athletes display their strength that they have worked so hard for and much like celebrities, who worked hard to get where they are. Celebrities who truly love America, appreciate our veterans and appreciate those who have determination, resilience and resolve to become the best versions of themselves should be behind the Agoge Challenge 100 percent. The question I ask is why aren't more behind this event? Especially with how mainstream media and celebrities are quick to utilize veterans or in my opinion exploit them for their personal benefit. This is a place to empower them.”\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Jeff Kyle</strong>- <em>Guardian for Heroes Foundation</em>\n\n\"As a veteran I feel the need to give back and continue to help my fellow veterans. The Agoge Challenge not only allows each individual veteran the chance to prove to themselves that nothing is out of the question but also to show the world that we as veterans are unstoppable. We are strong minded, hard working people that look adversity in the face and punch it!\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidvobora\" target=\"_blank\">David Vobora</a>-</strong> <em>St. Louis Rams, Seattle Seahawks Linebacker</em>\n\nDavid Has been The Agoge Challenge's biggest advocate and came onboard as our brand ambassador and our media relations specialist this year.\n\nDavid: “Physical challenges are the best metaphors for life. Life is about competing and trying to become a better version of yourself daily. Just like training there is no destination, you can always become better. The Agoge Challenge is an opportunity for anyone to test themselves and discover a gear beyond their own capacity. The Agoge Challenge inspires all who come across it’s path!” It celebrates those willing to be uncomfortable to find growth. Although the competition is physical, it is very much a spiritual journey that empowers.”\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3><strong>Q: If readers want to support the Agoge movement, how should they reach out?</strong></h3>\nA: Contact us via our homesite <a href=\"http://www.fullcatabolic.com\">www.fullcatabolic.com</a>.

Fat.</h2>\nWho doesn’t like the sound of that?\n\nWhether you have a significant amount of weight to lose, just need to tone up a little or want better mental focus throughout the day, it’s in everyone’s best interest to give their body the chance to adapt to become a better fat burner.\n\nSo how does one go about doing this, exactly?\n\nLet’s talk about what not to do first, because unfortunately, this category is what many of the go-to means of reaching this goal fall under.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>3 Fat-loss Pitfalls to Avoid</h4>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Don’t wander into the local vitamin supply shop and pick up a bottle of magical ‘fat burning pills’. Often, they nothing more than a blend of stimulants, some of which can actually be quite dangerous<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>, that do nothing more than suppress the appetite and cause heart palpitations!</li>\n</ul>\n[Tweet \"\"Don’t wander into the vitamin supply shop and buy a bottle of magical ‘fat burning pills’.\" -Paleoista\"]\n<ul>\n\t<li>Don’t read up on how to implement intermittent fasting and/or fasted training and then do too much too soon. If you’re an endurance athlete who’s been training on carbohydrate for years and years, going out for that five hour ride followed by an hour long brick run at threshold on empty isn’t going to result in the workout of your life. Someone who has not allowed their body time to adapt to fat burning is more likely to end up experiencing a horrible bonk<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a> which might leave you at the gas station chowing down on anything and everything you can get your chompers on!</li>\n</ul>\n[Tweet \"\"Don’t read up on how to implement intermittent fasting and then do too much too soon.\" -Paleoista\"]\n<ul>\n\t<li>Don’t believe the hype…that we athletes must have glycogen stored up in our skeletal muscles and liver to function for even very long bouts of endurance activity, or that our brain can only make the small amount of glucose needed to function from carbohydrate.   In <em>The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Performance </em>by Drs. Volek and Phinney<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a>, we know that we can “train our bodies to burn fat by simply changing the diet over a period of time, thereby turning blood sugar and glycogen into secondary fuels.  Once you make this transition, you can then train harder, perform longer, and recover faster.”</li>\n</ul>\n[Tweet \"\"We can train our bodies to burn fat by simply changing the diet over a period of time.\" -Paleoista\"]\n\n<hr />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>2 Tips for a Fat-Adapted Life</h4>\nAnd now that we know what to avoid, added to the fact that the human brain functions best based on what to do, rather than what not to do, below are some tips to make your transition even easier:\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Start out slowly.</strong> If you’ve ever just gotten up first thing in the morning and headed out for your run prior to eating, you’ve already begun working in a fasted state.   Now, just build up the time you spend training this way, and before you know it, you won’t even want that smoothie before you head out to sweat!<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5175\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000037303924_XXXLarge-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"mixed_raw_nuts_healthy_fat\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></li>\n\t<li><strong>Tweak your macros</strong>. Becoming fat adapted isn’t just for workouts; it’s for daily life in general. In a ketogenic approach, it’s important to include some high fat days, with up to 80% of calories coming from an array of fats like avocado, coconut oil and pure MCT oil, olive oil, duck fat and some raw nuts. According to Dr. Perlmutter, MD<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]</a>, “Our bodies enter ketosis at the point when blood sugar and liver glycogen are no longer present, and our system resorts to using ketones for fuel. At this point, not only is our body doing the natural thing, and burning off fat, it’s also powering up our brain!”</li>\n</ul>\n[Tweet \"Pro Tip: To burn fat, include high fat days in your diet, 80% of calories coming from healthy fats.\"]\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>How I Did It and You Can Too</h4>\nOn a personal note, admittedly, it took me a long time to begin to test this approach, as I’d been racing ironman quite successfully for years, keeping Paleo since 2005, but always thinking I had to default to the ‘one non Paleo item in my regime’ for long racing and training- the ubiquitous carbohydrate gel.\n\nHowever, after playing around with short bouts of fasted training, only up to about two hours over the last two years, I finally made the switch earlier this season and am seeing marked improvements in wattage output on the bike, speed capability on the run, tremendous recovery and incredible mental clarity.\n\n<em><strong>And the numbers don’t lie, either, in a mere six weeks’ time, my triglycerides, already low and in the healthy range, went down by more than half and the extra off-season two pounds slipped right off.</strong></em>\n\nIt’s not just particular to me, either; clients of mine, athletes and non-athletes alike are finding tremendous success applying these tips to maximize fat burning potential.\n\nCurious about learning how?\n<h4>Schedule a 1-hour consultation with the Paleoista</h4>\n<a href=\"http://www.paleoista.com/store/#!/One-Hour-Consultation-In-Person-SKYPE-or-Phone/p/8459815/category=1964642\" target=\"_blank\">Contact me for your consult, available globally, and get yourself set up on your path to optimal, fat burning Paleo health!</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"></a>\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>References</strong>\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> \"Harmful Effects of Fat Burners.\" LIVESTRONG.COM.

You want to be in great shape, you want to do your best at work or school, be the best spouse and parent you can be, you want a sense of fulfillment and meaning and you want to have plenty of happiness and affluence in your life.

I certainly hope so, otherwise you are likely to have a difficult time really healing. </em>\n\nThis is the definitive method I use in my daily medical practice to maximize your healing. The sooner you apply these tips, the faster you will empower your body to heal better, and longer.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>Define Healing for Yourself</h4>\nSometime in my sixth year of medical training I asked myself the question, “What is healing?” and was astounded by the realization that I didn’t know. None of my teachers had ever talked about it. I thought this was ludicrous so I started searching for my own definition. I searched for years through all sorts of medical disciplines, through philosophy, through religious teaching from all over the world. Nothing I found seemed both broad enough to fit for everyone’s experience (health is a perfectly functioning physical body) while being practical enough to actually take into an exam room and apply to a patient and their health issues (health is balance and harmony with the Cosmos.)\n\n<strong>Eventually I realized that, though I could not define healing, I could recognize it when one of my patients experienced it</strong>. I could sense that healing was more than the resolution of symptoms, I just couldn’t put my finger on it. I reasoned this way: if symptoms are clues that healing needs to happen, then the resolution of the symptoms are clues that the healing has happened, it is not the healing itself. So I started watching my patients who healed in an attempt to see what else had changed in them besides their symptoms going away. Quickly I noticed that they had also learned something. For the most part, they learned more about themselves, about how to be in their power, about who they really are underneath society’s domestication, deeper than the woundings, abandonments and disappointments of life.\n\nI thought to myself, “I wonder if this learning about one’s self is the healing?” and <strong>I came up with the definition that “healing is the process of finding out who you really are and then living true to that.”</strong> I have been using this definition now for about twenty years and haven’t outgrown it or found it to be too limiting, so I’m starting to think that there may be something useful to it. I found that most proposed definitions for healing were really just descriptions of some particular result of healing and, in that regard, my definition may be no different, I have just found it particularly helpful. Honestly, I believe that the heart of healing is mostly a mystery and we may never have it within our full control. (But much benefit can still be gained by learning to work with the mystery.)\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4> Avoid The Urge to Suppress Healing</h4>\nOnce you learn to see life as an educational process--all of your experiences are the curriculum, all of creation is the classroom, your conscious sense of self is the student, the learning objective is to answer the question “Who am I?” and the teacher is your own deep inner wisdom. From this perspective,<strong> any treatment that suppresses symptoms without helping you receive the learning buried in that experience actually just prolongs your suffering.</strong> Most conventional and even alternative treatments do this.\n\nToday I see my role as an MD to help people consult with their own deep inner knowing.\n\n“What is that?” you may ask.\n\nHave you heard the saying, “You have within you the answers to all of your questions”? Do you believe it? I certainly hope so, otherwise you are likely to have a difficult time really healing. You have within you a deep knowing that, if you could but bring it forward in your life, the results would astound you. Imagine what your life could be like if you could consult with that inner wisdom any time you wanted to.\n\nImagine knowing answers to questions like “what should I do with my life?” or “how do I find real happiness?” or even more day-to-day questions like “what would be best for me to eat right now?”\n\n[Tweet \"Imagine knowing answers to questions like “what should I do with my life?” or “how do I find real happiness?”\"]\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4><strong>Increase Your Conscious Self Awareness </strong></h4>\nDeep inside you know the answers to abstract and foundational questions posed above. And there are ways you can let that knowing into your conscious mind. I found a way to help my patients access their inner knowing through the combination of advanced Craniosacral Therapy and clinical hypnosis. Once a person connected with their inner knowing, it took on the role of personal life coach and taught them a set of skills. <strong>When my patients applied those newly learned skills to whatever was happening in their life, they found the learning in the experience and healed.</strong>\n\nI noticed an amazing consistency to these skills: they were the same no matter the person’s age, gender, level of education, religious beliefs, cultural background, diseases they faced or anything else I could observe. I started to call these skills “The Seven Tools of Healing” because, well…there are seven of them, and when people used them, they healed.\n\nSoon I learned that if I taught my patients these seven skills and they started to practice them, not only did connecting with their inner wisdom get easier but they could connect on their own without my assistance or the need for hypnosis. They were able to listen to their life and know for themselves how best to respond. They knew how best to eat, to exercise, who to call to spend time with, how to deal with stress, what therapies to use and such. I want you to have that same advantage so I want to teach you the Seven Tools of Healing and encourage you to practice them for yourself.\n\nRead my next article on the Seven Tools of Healing.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4><strong>Questions?</strong></h4>\nLeave your questions in the comments forum below to learn about real healing.","Slug":"guide-recognize-maximize-healing","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/guide-recognize-maximize-healing/","Path":"/interesting_other/guide-recognize-maximize-healing/","Date":"2015-05-19","Year":"2015","Month":"05","Day":"19","Categories":"Health Tips | Interesting Other","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/women_tracking_health_fitness-e1431579263880.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/women_tracking_health_fitness-e1431579263880.jpg","Image Alt Text":"women_tracking_fitness_maximize_healing"},{"id":"5180","Title":"GIVEAWAY: $125 Total Health & Fit Expo","Meta Description":"The Total Health & Fit Expo brings cutting edge products, services and ideas to the Expo.

By the time I was old enough to sing and dance along to his music, he'd reached the puffier, white-jumpsuit-phase of his career, but I loved him with a pure-hearted devotion. I'd make my babysitter watch me as I stood on my bed, singing \"Burning Love\" and throwing scarves in the audience, just like Elvis (whom I watched on TV) and the Elvis impersonator my mom took me to see at the State Fairgrounds.\n\nLater, as an adult, I learned about Elvis's favorite meal: It was a grilled peanut butter, banana, and bacon sandwich with an optional drizzle of honey. One year for Thanksgiving, my husband and I decided to make Elvis sandwiches instead of the traditional turkey. It was glorious — and a once-in-a-lifetime event.\n\nBut once I tasted the nutty+bacony goodness, I couldn't forget about it, and this Elvis Burger rose out of the junk food ashes like a phoenix. I replaced the peanut butter with Sunbutter (see ya, legumes!), and ditched the bun for a lettuce wrap. Thanks to caramelized bananas, there's really no need for honey, but if you want to take it over the top, a little drizzle will do the trick.\n\n<strong>Elvis Burger</strong>\n\n<em>Serves 2-4 | Prep 10 min | Cook 10 min</em>\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5224\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/elvis_burger-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"elvis_burger\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></strong>\n\n<strong>Ingredients:</strong>\n1 pound ground beef\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\n4 slices sugar-free bacon\n2 medium bananas, peeled and diced\n1/4 teaspoon ground ginger\n1/4 cup sunflower seed or almond butter (no sugar added)\n\n<strong>Directions:</strong>\n1. Preheat a gas grill with all burners on high, lid closed, 10-15 minutes.\n\n2. Mix the ground beef with salt and pepper and shape into four patties. Gently press down the center of each patty until it’s about 1/2-inch thick to make a slight depression; this will prevent them from turning bulbous when you cook them. Grill patties, uncovered and without pressing down on them, until they’re seared on one side, about 3 minutes. Flip the burgers and continue grilling to desired temperature: 3 minutes for rare, 4 minutes for medium, and 5 minutes for well-done.\n\n3. While the burgers are cooking, cut the bacon into 1-inch pieces. Place in a cold, nonstick skillet, then turn heat to medium-high and cook until browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon to a paper towel to drain. Pour all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat out of the pan. Add the bananas and ginger to the pan and sauté until soft and lightly browned, about 3-5 minutes. Set aside.\n\n4. Place the sunflower butter in a microwave-safe dish (or saucepan on the stove) and heat until thinned, about 40 seconds in the microwave.\n\n5. When the burgers are good to go, top each with 1 tablespoon of melted sunflower butter and a few tablespoons of the bananas, then sprinkle with bacon. Feel free to sing your favorite Elvis tune while you chow down.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> You can also pan-fry or bake the burgers. On the stovetop, cook in a nonstick skillet, 5 minutes, then flip and continue to cook: 3 minutes for rare, 4 minutes for medium, 5 minutes for well-done. In the oven, bake at 400F for 20-25 minutes.","Slug":"elvis-burger","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/healthy_recipes/elvis-burger/","Path":"/healthy_recipes/elvis-burger/","Date":"2015-06-02","Year":"2015","Month":"06","Day":"02","Categories":"Paleo Recipes","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/elvis_burger.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/zingygingerdressing.png","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/elvis_burger.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/zingygingerdressing.png","Image Alt Text":" | zingy-ginger-dressing"},{"id":"5226","Title":"DIY Zingy Ginger Dressing","Meta Description":"Zingy Ginger Dressing is shockingly delicious -- on salads, grilled meats, and cooked veggies.

I know that probably seems like a strange thing to say. How can a salad dressing be a favorite food?! But it's true! When carrots, onions, ginger, and oil are puréed together, they become creamy, light, luscious, and so much more than their individual parts. Every time I make this dressing, I say \"It's so good!\" — or, really it's more like, <em>\"Eet*s thoooo guuuu#*d!\"</em> because I'm trying to gleefully say the words while simultaneously licking the spatula.\n\nWhip up a batch of Zingy Ginger Dressing and keep it in the fridge for anytime you have a Boring Food Emergency.

Achieving clean eating can be a revolutionary feeling! Making sure you have the rest down pat will help you feel even more fantastic.\n\nHere are five Paleo pointers to help you get there:\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>#1: I’ve got a pocket, got a pocket full of SUNshine…</strong></h3>\nSo you’ve cut out the foods that were holding you back and your body is running on clean fuel like a top speed dragster. With all the good you’re doing for your body, make sure that you don’t miss out on Vitamin D. It’s not found in dietary sources on the Paleo plan<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>, so you’ll need to make sure that you get a natural dose every day. The good news is that it’s as simple as getting out in the sunlight! The amount of rays you need depends on a lot of factors like the weather, the season and where you live. For sound advice on getting optimal rays visit <a href=\"http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/about-vitamin-d/how-do-i-get-the-vitamin-d-my-body-needs/\">www.vitamindcouncil.org</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>#2: Relax. You’ve got time.</strong></h3>\nYour Paleo lifestyle gives you the energy and the stamina to take on your day, your workout and your life. With all that goodness going on it can be hard to remember to give your body and your mind the time to relax and reboot. Stress wreaks havoc on our bodies, causing disease and even accelerated aging<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a>. Some stress is pretty unavoidable, but if you take the time to focus on relaxing for even just a few minutes each day you’ll reap the rewards. Why not meditate for five minutes or take a nap in that lonely hammock out in the yard? For more relaxation ideas visit <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/blissing-out-10-relaxation-techniques-reduce-stress-spot\">www.webmd.com</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>#3: Vegetables are your friends!</strong></h3>\nNoshing on a plate of steak and buttery yams is pretty darn satisfying and not thinking about counting the calories borders on a relaxation activity in itself! The Paleo lifestyle definitely has its perks. It’s easy to fill up on high quality protein and skip the fruits and veggies. Keep balance in mind and be sure to eat plenty of non-starchy vegetables every day. It’s also a great idea to take in some whole fruit, depending on your weight loss goals and your blood sugar balance.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a> To learn more visit <a href=\"http://paleologix.com/about/dietary-guidelines/\">paleologix.com</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>#4: Sometimes life requires preparation.</strong></h3>\nYou’ve learned to love the time you spend making healthy choices, chopping veggies and grilling like a boss. In a perfect world every meal would be that way. The truth is that sometimes you’re on the go. If you’re combining your Paleo lifestyle with demanding physical activity, it’s more important than ever that you fuel your performance. Keeping ready-made easy access options on hand is a must. AMRAP has the cure for what ails you: delicious protein bars that pack a Paleo punch and taste great too. Get yours at <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/\">www.amrapnutrition.com</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>#5: Rome wasn’t built in a day, and it wasn’t built <u>alone</u> either.</strong></h3>\nOne of the most unique assets of the Paleo lifestyle is the community. Interacting with other people can really help boost your success. Maybe an online forum member can talk you through a tough spot or share recipes. Someone closer to home might be a motivating workout buddy or a clean eating dinner date. The Paleo community is out there, and you don’t have to look far.

I stumbled across this healthy masterpiece in a restaurant, and it had me completely hooked, as it tasted amazing, and used only three main ingredients. I never imagined asparagus soup could be that mouth-watering on its own but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Why use organic asparagus?</strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\nA slight correction though, this soup uses farm fresh <a href=\"http://www.stepin2mygreenworld.com/healthyliving/greenfoods/the-many-health-benefits-of-eating-asparagus/\" target=\"_blank\">organic asparagus</a>, which is healthier than its ordinary counterpart as it combines the wholesomeness of the vegetable and organic food. It has several benefits such as:\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>Packed with anti-inflammatory elements like asparanin A, sarsasapogenin, protodioscin, and diosgenin.</li>\n\t<li>Prevents chronic inflammation, which in turn is responsible for many chronic illnesses like arthritis, heart disease, and even cancer.</li>\n\t<li>It has numerous antioxidants like beta-carotene, vitamin E and vitamin C – your immune system becomes stronger as the body is protected from oxidative stress, which helps it to fight off diseases quickly and effectively.</li>\n\t<li>The amino acids in this vegetable are believed to have anti-tumor effects.</li>\n\t<li>It contains inulin, a carbohydrate used to feed the good bacteria in the digestive tract, thus helping to promote digestion.</li>\n\t<li>It has vitamin B in good quantities that is useful in controlling blood sugar and improving overall heart health. Dietary fibers in it also reduce the risks for heart diseases.</li>\n\t<li>Last but not the least; organic asparagus is free pesticides and other toxic chemicals.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>A few serving suggestions…</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis soup can be an even bigger hit if you can serve it well. sliced fresh avocado or grilled green and red bell peppers will work great, as it stimulates the taste buds and heighten sensations on the tongue – the soup tastes even more scrumptious.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI have included options for seasoning if you want to experiment with the flavor and taste. If you want to stick to the conventional method, use only sea salt, as that is more than sufficient to bring out the rich, creamy tang. The best part is that my kids loved it and kept on asking me to make it repeatedly!\n\nReady to create this dish? <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-recipes/paleo-creamy-asparagus-soup/\" target=\"_blank\">Download my recipe cards here.</a>\n\n&nbsp;","Slug":"creamy-asparagus-soup","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/creamy-asparagus-soup/","Path":"/interesting_other/creamy-asparagus-soup/","Date":"2015-05-29","Year":"2015","Month":"05","Day":"29","Categories":"Interesting Other | Paleo Recipes","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/paleo-creamy-asparagus-soup.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/paleo-creamy-asparagus-soup.jpg","Image Alt Text":"paleo-creamy-asparagus-soup"},{"id":"5238","Title":"Chewy Paleo Chocolate Chip Cookies","Meta Description":"As you bite into one of my paleo chocolate chip cookies and feel the warm melty heat of still warm ingredients you'll be grinning wide. This is pure joy.","Content":"<h2>A Classic Recipe Made Timeless</h2>\nIf you have a sweet tooth like me, then I am sure you have a fondness for chocolate chip cookies too! When I was a kid, I was always sneaking into the kitchen and emptying the entire cookie jar in a few hours! Despite repeated admonishing by my mother, I kept doing it as I simply couldn’t resist the yummy, crunchy taste.\n\nThat was certainly a different time in terms of food.\n\n<strong>The Paleo diet…</strong>\n\nAs I grew up, I got bitten by the health bug. I read many articles regarding the food we eat and its direct effect on our current and future health. That is how I came across the <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/paleolithic-diet-paleo-foods-athletes/\" target=\"_blank\">Paleo diet</a>, which is based on imitating the eating habits of our ancestors. It allows you to enjoy robust health by providing natural nourishment free from side effects. Now, the Paleo diet suggests staying away from foods with refined sugar, candy, sweetened beverages and other sugary stuff and it was a huge roadblock for me, as it meant abstaining from one of my favorite treats!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Combining Paleo with cookies…</strong>\n\nI started researching about Paleo diet in detail, and thankfully came across several variations of chocolate cookie recipes that were in compliance with the principles of Paleo. It is a quick and easy method to stay healthy and also indulge in delicious chocolate chip cookies. I have used <a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/252180-what-are-the-benefits-of-organic-honey/\" target=\"_blank\">organic honey</a> for sweetening instead of sugar. Unlike its non-organic counterpart, this type of honey is free from contamination like pesticides, antibiotics or other synthetic components. It is safe and adds wonderfully to the flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI know that some of you might not be a fan of <a href=\"http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/6-health-benefits-of-dark-chocolate.html\" target=\"_blank\">dark chocolate</a> due to its bitter essence. But trust me; it doesn’t affect the overall taste of these cookies. Moreover, dark chocolate is good for the heart and brain, packed with antioxidants, controls blood sugar levels, and contains lots of nutrients. It also has theobromine that hardens tooth enamel and reduces possibilities of cavities. Adding nuts is optional though I would suggest cashew nuts or blanched almonds. You can try macadamia nuts as well. A bonus is that nuts also boost the fatty acids content in the body.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nChocolate chip cookies are best served with a cool glass of almond milk, but you are welcome to bake a batch and serve it as dessert or starters. Regardless of these factors, I can guarantee this platter of cookies will soon make their way into your bellies!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-recipes/tinas-amazing-paleo-chocolate-chip-cookies/\" target=\"_blank\">Click to Download the Paleo Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe cards</a> and enjoy every bite!","Slug":"chewy-paleo-chocolate-chip-cookies","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/chewy-paleo-chocolate-chip-cookies/","Path":"/interesting_other/chewy-paleo-chocolate-chip-cookies/","Date":"2015-06-20","Year":"2015","Month":"06","Day":"20","Categories":"Interesting Other","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/paleo-chocolate-chip-cookies1.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/paleo-chocolate-chip-cookies1.jpg","Image Alt Text":"paleo-chocolate-chip-cookies1"},{"id":"5245","Title":"Cashew Chicken Stir-Fry","Meta Description":"One of my favorite lunches is a cashew chicken stir-fry.

On top of this, the price for a family membership (six kids and two adults) was less than a membership for my wife and I at a CrossFit box. Yes, you have tradeoffs, but I like that I can be active with my kids.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>What else do we get for our membership?  Access to the outdoor pool all summer for all of us ($600 savings) and access to an indoor soccer field (all my kids play soccer), access to basketball courts, racquetball courts, free yoga and spin classes, and the list keeps going.

Get a juicer</h4>\n<div>Gotta get this. I won't be 100% fanatic, though I bet I'll soon be 90% plant-based.</div>\n<div></div>\n<h4>3. Form a strategy to buy and store large quantities of fruits and vegetables</h4>\n<div>This is the hardest part. How can I affordably do this?

Not as a hydration mix.","Content":"<h2>We want to know if coconut water delivers hydration like good ol' H2O</h2>\n<h2></h2>\nIt´s completely clear the healthy trend over coconut water. The nutritional composition, antioxidants, potassium, low calorie profile, low acidity, and a very particular taste, make coconut water a must to analyze in a close look for any health and fitness lifestyle advocate.\n\nI segmented my analysis in three categories--fluids, electrolytes, and sugar. In my cycling and running, I've found these three to have the most significant factor in overall fitness and performance.\n\nSo, jumping right in--\n<h3>Fluid:</h3>\nThe natural coconut water is a transparent liquid that forms inside the coconut. The liquid itself is a unique chemical composition of water, sugars, vitamins, minerals, amino acids and phytohormones.<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are mainly two kinds of coconuts: young (green) and old (dark). When drinking coconut water the preference should be towards young coconut water, since the nutritional contest is far more dense than the dark coconuts; that is because the freshness: the younger, the greenest and when it comes to coconut water: fresher is better!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Electrolytes:</h3>\nElectrolyte content of coconut water is high in potassium, but low in sodium, calcium and magnesium. As we remember form <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/hydration-affects-performance-part-1/\">Hydration Part 1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/how_to/hydration-affects-performance-part-2/\">Part 2</a>, the main source for proper hydration is the mix of fluid (water) and sodium (key electrolyte for hydration). When it comes to the high potassium levels in coconut water, is not exactly related with proper daily hydration and should not be your beverage of choice for sport performance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHigh potassium levels are required to fight a dehydrated state where the intra cellular fluid of the cells (which is rich in potassium) has been lost, meaning that the dehydration state is dangerous, normally achieved since the hydration protocol of fluid + sodium was not followed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor keep hydrated on a daily base or in a the moderate to intense exercise activity, coconut water will not constitute a great hydration fluid-electrolyte blend since the connected of sodium is low and high in potassium. Drinking coconut water in excess can lead to <em><strong>hyperkalemia</strong></em>, which is the excess of potassium in the bloodstream and can lead to dangerous, and possibly deadly, changes in heart rhythm<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo from the hydration point, coconut water is more considered a supplement, but is far from your best option.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Sugar:</h3>\nThe sugars naturally contained in coconut are glucose 35 to 50%, sucrose 18 to 35% and glucose 12 to 36%, depending on the maturation of the coconut<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a>. That mix of sugars is quiet fine for a pre or post workout healthy shake, but I will never recommend it as a all-day beverage, since it’s still sugar and will raise your insulin response. We want sugar in our body when it needs it: right before or after the moderate to intense exercise.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI recommend coconut water as a healthy treat or as a great pre/post workout base for your heathy smoothie. Never as a hydration mix.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Tips for picking the best coconut water:</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Always prefer to buy the green coconut, cutting it yourself and drinking directly from the source.</li>\n\t<li>Look for 100% green coconut water with no preservatives, added sugars or fancy packages. The simpler, the better.</li>\n\t<li>Coconut water is far more delicate to temperature changes than dairy products, so keep it cool always!</li>\n\t<li>Use the coconut water as the base for your pre and post workout meals, don’t go crazy with it. Keep drinking water and sodium as your hydration blend, remember that you should think of coconut water as a great source of healthy sugars, vitamins, antioxidants and amino acids more than as a sport drink, hydration beverage or substitute for tap water.</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"></a>\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>References:</strong>\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a><a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/40768354_The_Chemical_Composition_and_Biological_Properties_of_Coconut_(Cocos_nucifera_L.)_Water\">http://www.researchgate.net/publication/40768354_The_Chemical_Composition_and_Biological_Properties_of_Coconut_(Cocos_nucifera_L.)_Water</a>\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a> <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hyperkalemia-causes-symptoms-treatments\">http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hyperkalemia-causes-symptoms-treatments</a>\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> <a href=\"http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jped/v82n4/en_v82n4a14.pdf\">http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jped/v82n4/en_v82n4a14.pdf</a>","Slug":"coconut-water-for-performance","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/coconut-water-for-performance/","Path":"/interesting_other/coconut-water-for-performance/","Date":"2015-06-19","Year":"2015","Month":"06","Day":"19","Categories":"Interesting Other | Nutrition Hacks | Performance Advice | Reviews","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Coconut-Water-Performance-Benefits1.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Coconut-Water-Performance-Benefits.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Coconut-Water-Performance-Benefits1.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Coconut-Water-Performance-Benefits.jpg","Image Alt Text":"Coconut-Water-Performance-Benefits | "},{"id":"5252","Title":"Paleo Blueberry Peach Cobbler (GF)","Meta Description":"Gluten Free and Paleo never tasted so sweet.

Dedicated belief factors largely in our recovery and health.","Content":"<h2>Are you using healing therapies, like faith conditioning, to improve your fitness psychology?</h2>\nI know. Faith is a loaded word. Believe me, as a conventionally trained MD and science nerd, I had a hard time even saying it at first. And of the seven aspects of how people’s inner wisdom helped them make lasting changes in their lives, Faith was the last one I became aware of, but I had to put it first because of the way our healing/recovery process works.\n\nFaith is the foundation upon which everything else you think you know is built. Even scientific knowledge is built on foundational assumptions about Nature, which have to change from time to time, as Thomas Kuhn so eloquently described in his amazing book <u><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Scientific-Revolutions-Thomas-Kuhn/dp/0226458083\" target=\"_blank\">The Structure of Scientific Revolution</a></u>. You know your mother is your mother because you believe her. How do you know you weren’t switched in the nursery at birth?\n\n[Tweet \"When faith reaches the level of certainty, things really start to happen. - Muhammad Ali\"]\n\nFaith also imbues the object of faith with a greater certainty of manifestation. In other words, the power of your faith is proportional to the power of your ability to manifest, to bring your dreams to fruition. Muhammad Ali, the great spiritual sage, once noted that “when faith reaches the level of certainty, things really start to happen.”\n\nFaith is unique from other healing therapies as it needs no proof, no data. In fact, that’s sort of the point of faith. But this property of faith is both a strength and a liability. Because it needs no proof or data, people can use their faith to believe in the wackiest things, or in things that really block their healing. This is a problem because of the power of beliefs, which we’ll get into.\n\n<em>But if you mix equal parts faith with equal parts reason, you get a really useful concoction.</em>\n\nWithin the context of a gym or a race, you have total control over what you choose to believe in. You can have faith your abilities, in your training, and in your future success. Of course reason reminds you that a PR deadlift is out of reach, no matter your absolute belief, if you have not been physically prepping your body. How many people have we seen with the obvious strength to complete a task, but they fail? Or an athlete with a catastrophic injury, make a unexplainable full recovery?  It is mental.\n\nSo, if faith is a choice, why not choose to believe whatever helps you the most? For example, you can have faith that healing is always possible, and not just for everyone else, but for you, too. Or have faith that if you could just be your true, authentic self, that would be enough in your life. You don’t have to be more than that or settle for less. You can have faith in yourself: that you will know how to handle whatever life puts in your path, that you will always have an ability to respond. Or think of some things that, if you had faith in them, would help you in your life.\n\nPeople’s inner wisdom uses faith as a foundation but it also continually asks people to have faith in it, in other words, it asks people to trust what they know. Trust what you know. If you really admitted to yourself what you know about yourself, the vast majority of the time, you would be right. Most of the time when you get into trouble, you have over-ridden what you know deep inside to be right and gone with what your head wants.\n\nYour inner wisdom also uses faith in the process of changing and updating your beliefs. One of the properties of beliefs is they comb through all of your experiences and highlight for special attention those that reinforce or support it. So, over time, you collect up a lot of direct experiential data to prove to yourself that that belief is true (whether it is or not.) When you realize that that belief is too limiting, that it is holding you back, you have to jettison it (the “hows” on that one will be in a future blog) and replace it with a new belief. When you first adopt a new belief, it hasn’t had time to collect any of its own special data so you have to accept it on faith. At first. As soon as the new belief settles into your non-conscious mind and becomes part of your “structure of interpretation,” your world view, it will bring you plenty of experiences to prove itself to you.\n\n[Tweet \"So, if faith is a choice, why not choose to believe whatever helps you the most? \"]\n\nDoubt is a test of faith. If the doubt wins, if you start to doubt yourself, for example, that means your faith isn’t strong enough.\n\n<em>Go back the faith gym and give it another workout. Pep talks to yourself work great here.</em>\n\nFaith is tricky to learn how to use skillfully. It’s a blank canvas; it’s a car you can drive over any terrain. You get to choose where to aim it, how to apply it. Experiment, try different things, give yourself permission to make a few mistakes, just learn as much as you can from them. As I said, faith in cahoots with reason can be a very powerful ally.","Slug":"1-loaded-concept-that-aides-recovery","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/1-loaded-concept-that-aides-recovery/","Path":"/interesting_other/1-loaded-concept-that-aides-recovery/","Date":"2015-06-20","Year":"2015","Month":"06","Day":"20","Categories":"Interesting Other","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fitness-psychology-faith-conditioning.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fitness-psychology-faith-conditioning.jpg","Image Alt Text":"fitness-psychology-faith-conditioning"},{"id":"5255","Title":"Fitness Psychology 101: Practice Awareness","Meta Description":"Practice awareness is a skill.

The basic premise is that it is much easier to work on an issue in your life, whether it is a physical illness, a bothersome emotion or limiting belief, if you know it is there. Awareness moves something from the not-known over to the known.\n\n<em>Remember, healing is the process of finding out who you really are and then making choices that are in alignment with that.</em> So becoming aware of who you are and the details of your personal moment-to-moment truth is critical for healing.\n\nYour life is feeding you clues about who you are all day (and night) long.

Awareness is a skill that gets better with practice. <strong>So how does one practice awareness, you ask? </strong>In the most basic sense, you can become aware of something simply by focusing your attention on it, but let's take this further.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Awareness is Mental Data Mining</h3>\nWherever you focus your attention, your mind just naturally starts taking in and making conscious sense out of the sensory data. For example, take a moment and just cast your eyes around the room or wherever you are. Notice that wherever your eyes land, you start to take in data about what you are seeing. Then your mind decides what the data means. What is registering on your retinas are just colored patches of light. If you want to get nerdy with me, it is your mind that says “that’s a window” or “that’s the corner of the walls and ceiling,” etc. So if you want to start becoming aware of something, simply focus your attention on it. Where you focus your attention is a choice you get to make. Curiosity about what you are looking at increases how much you take in and retain.\n\n<strong>FUN FACT:</strong> You know how there is wisdom buried in our language, like “health,” “wholeness,” “hale,” “hearty” and “holy” all coming from the same root word? Interestingly, “cure” and “curiosity” also come from the same root word.\n\nThen again, how do you focus awareness on the squishy, non-tangible aspects of your life. When it's not a physical three-dimensional object, how can we practice awareness? Moreover how will that focus on the intangible help me recognize something like poor form or a damaging mindset?\n\nI would argue that the intangible awareness we cultivate manifests most positively, so let's learn how and what to focus on.\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Awareness for Intangibles</h3>\nThese are some of the aspects of your life that you can deepen your awareness of simply by choosing to focus your attention upon them:\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Physical feelings</strong> — what information is my body sending me right now?</li>\n\t<li><strong>Emotional feelings</strong> — how am I feeling? What belief is behind it? What is a healthy response to it?</li>\n\t<li><strong>Thoughts and mental activity</strong> — what am I thinking? What stimulated that thought? What belief(s) is/are influencing my conclusions? Are my thoughts in alignment with what I want to achieve? This thought is showing me how I’m currently directing the flow of my Consciousness and creativity. Is this how I want my Consciousness flowing right now?</li>\n\t<li><strong>The energetic</strong> — both within your body and with regard to your present situation. How is my energy flowing? Are there any blocks? How is my vitality right now? What is influencing it? What is it asking of me?</li>\n\t<li><strong>Beliefs</strong> – what are the beliefs underlying my thoughts and feelings? What are the beliefs that make up my world view? How do these beliefs look from a higher or Spiritual perspective?</li>\n\t<li><strong>Dreams</strong> — (dreams can be viewed as an important means of communication between the conscious and non-conscious aspects of the mind) what feelings do the dreams evoke? What symbolic meaning does the dream have?</li>\n\t<li><strong>Actions</strong> — how do (did) I respond to various situations? What thoughts, feelings and beliefs are influencing my actions? What are the results of my actions? Are they congruent with what I want for my life?</li>\n\t<li><strong>Relationships</strong> — the eye (I) cannot see itself — what sides of me are being revealed in this symbolic “mirror”? What feelings come up in me as a result of the interactions I have in this relationship? What are the cultural and social influences?</li>\n\t<li><strong>Surroundings</strong> — how do shapes, colors, textures and the arrangement of the physical environment influence how I feel? How am I influenced by the weather, traffic, world events or other factors in the environment? This one is analyzing the affect of tangible objects on personal psychology.</li>\n</ul>\nThere may be even more aspects of your life you want to attend to. Every experience you have is a chance to deepen your understanding of yourself.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>One Awareness Practice That Has Helped Me.</h3>\nI like to go on walks in the evenings. Luckily, I live in the country where the roads are not very busy. As I’m walking, I challenge myself to become as aware as I can of everything I can see: the shapes of the trees in the starlight, the edges of the road, the distant houses and fences and such. As soon as I feel like I am really taking in and registering the visual, I hold onto that and start to add in what I can hear: my feet on the road, the swooshing of my clothing, my dog’s footsteps, wind in the trees, distant cars and such. As soon as I feel comfortable with all I’m seeing and hearing, I become aware of what I am smelling: the night air, the different kinds of trees, the leaves molding on the ground and such. Then I add in what I can feel through my skin: the air temperature, my feet touching the ground, the belt around my waist and such. If at any time I get distracted or lose focus on any particular sensory modality, I just start over.\n\n<strong>You don’t have to do this kind of exercise only when you’re walking. Adapt it to whatever situation you are in and just set aside a few minutes a day to practice.</strong>\n\nTo summarize, if you see an aspect of yourself that you want to change and you try to force yourself to change it, what generally happens?\n\nRight. You get in an arms race with yourself and eventually fatigue, get distracted or otherwise give up. But what happens if you practice a skill? You generally get better at it. Then what you are just naturally able to do changes because you have new and better skills.\n\nTools like <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/1-loaded-concept-that-aides-recovery/\">faith conditioning</a> and practicing awareness are really skills that you practice and, as you get better at them, healing yourself just becomes automatically easier and more natural to you.\n\n&nbsp;","Slug":"fitness-psychology-101-practice-awareness","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/fitness-psychology-101-practice-awareness/","Path":"/interesting_other/fitness-psychology-101-practice-awareness/","Date":"2015-06-23","Year":"2015","Month":"06","Day":"23","Categories":"Behavioral Training | Health Tips | Interesting Other | Lifestyle Design","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/practice-awareness-improves-quality-of-life.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/practice-awareness-improves-quality-of-life.jpg","Image Alt Text":"practice-awareness-improves-quality-of-life"},{"id":"5256","Title":"Paleo Birthday Party Guide","Meta Description":"I cringe at birthday parties' havoc on my Paleo family, but I'll share what works for me, giving you a good place to start for an A+ Paleo Birthday Party.","Content":"<h2>How to keep your kiddo happy, healthy and included in a non-paleo environment</h2>\nI try not to think \"Oh S#@% -  a Birthday Party Invite,\" but every time presents so many challenges to our Paleo family.\n\nYou get the invite and all you can think about is kids stuffing themselves with birthday cake. It is the perfect combination of flour and sugars to make any kid do about anything to get it in their mouth. In some circles, this could be a definition of addiction.   What happens next is like a scene from a movie. Kids hanging from chandeliers, parents chasing them around, then the eventual crash when the sugar runs out.\n\nI would like to avoid these situations at all costs, but your child has friends...and we like to socialize!\n\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Here are some tips to make it through:</span>\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Paleo Treat</strong>-Bring something with you that your child can have instead of cake. Preferably something they have had before that really gets them excited to eat. You could make some cake, cookies, brownie, or cupcake. I have done this occasionally, but we really don’t want to make a whole batch just to take a piece with us to a party. If you do cookies, you can always freeze the rest for the next party. A lot of times we are busy and don’t remember till the day of that, oh yeah, we need to bring a snack for our son! Our son really likes macaroons and they usually have them at the grocery made with honey or maple syrup. Buying fruit or chocolate could be an option as well, depending what your child really likes.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Prep the situation-</strong>Talk to your child before you get to the party about what will be happening. Mention there will be cake but it hurts their tummy. You can tell them about how you will be bringing them something to have instead that will not hurt their tummy. My son is 3 ½ and already knows that all cupcakes are not created equal. Some could have ingredients that are not good for him and some won’t have much effect. Setting the situation up before hand is the key to having success (this goes along with every situation you have when raising kids). If you wait until all the other kids are eating cake, and you tell your child they are having something else instead, there is sure to be a meltdown.   We do this all the time and it works. He has his snack we brought him and then goes back to playing. Also, you can call ahead and figure out what else will be served. Maybe it is going to be a pizza party. My son can tolerate dairy, so we have him just eat the toppings off of the pizza in a pinch. I have also made pizza with cauliflower crust to eat instead. Again, planning ahead and prepping situation will keep you from getting in situations that are no wins for you as a parent!</li>\n\t<li><strong>My son ate cake-</strong>I have been to a birthday party and forgot to bring a substitute snack. At first, I was upset at myself for forgetting, but then we decided we could use it as a learning experience for our son. He almost didn’t have any cake because he was so busy playing with someone else’s toys. The parents are the ones that build this up. If we would have just went over to the party, did the activities, and played with some toys, my son would have chalked it up as a great day. Instead, we had to sit down and everybody have a piece of cake. In fact, my son was just playing while all the other kids were eating and someone asked him if he wanted some cake. Of course he said yes! My wife got him a small piece of cake and explained to him that there were ingredients in the cake he doesn’t normally eat. He did not get the mood swing, which he normally does if he gets sugar, but when we got home the flour hit him. His stomach starting aching then he had to sit on the toilet because of diarrhea. We explained to him why he got the diarrhea and talked to him about how he felt. We helped him connect the dots of what you eat and how you feel. Now he will still reference the birthday cake when we talk about things he should eat when we go to parties.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Kindly say no-</strong>Friends will not be offended if you don’t eat the cake they made (if they are offended, then they are probably not the best people to be in your tribe). We have recently moved to a new city in the last 2 years and we have gone to many birthday parties. Nobody has made faces or thought we were being mean to our son because he was not experiencing everything. I simply explain to them that we eat Paleo and our son has to avoid grains and refined sugar. I tell them we brought our own food for our son to have while everybody else is eating cake. I once thought I would just tell everybody our son has an allergy.   Then I realized that doesn’t help anybody and to help people on their healthy journey they need to know about the way we eat. Just make sure when you are telling people about the way you eat, avoid saying your way is right and their way is wrong. I feel like there is no quicker way to turn people off. Now at people’s houses, they make gluten free things or make more vegetable options because they know our diet. People want to be accommodating and make you feel welcome.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Make your party Paleo awesome-</strong>If your son or daughter is having a birthday party make sure to make everything Paleo friendly. Lead by example. Show people how you can make cupcakes without using refined flour or sugar. Kids will still eat these treats and think they taste delicious. At my son’s birthday party in January, we made all the food for the party. I did not hear one kid complain that the food tasted bad. We didn’t bring any chocolate pie or chocolate chip bars we made for the party home. For us that is usually a good measure of success on offerings when not much is brought home. We do the same if we are just having people over for dinner. We make everything how we want it made and it is usually a success. We want to be the example so people realize they can eat this way and it tastes good too. I wasn’t always a good cook or know how to do anything besides follow a recipe. It took a while of being comfortable with some different ingredients but it gets easier. If you don’t want to cook there are tons of places to get Paleo food and treats. Your local food coop, Natural Grocers, Sunflower Market, or Whole Foods is always a good place to start.</li>\n</ol>\nThese are things are that have worked for my family. They may not work perfect for yours, but it is good place to start.\n\nYou can have a Paleo birthday party successfully.\n\nThe first time you do it could be tough, but I promise it only gets easier after that. The biggest thing to make it work is communication with your child. Get input from them on the situation and treat them with respect instead of just saying you can eat this but you cannot eat that. Explain the why’s and make the food to feeling connection. When your child is more aware, they will feel more confident in the situation, even if they are eating something different from the other kids. Your kid will stay his/her normal self and the other kids will be crying and having meltdowns by the end of the party. Keep your kids on consistent energy level only makes for a happier family for everybody. I am interested to hear what things have worked for your families.

That’s a question many ask. Trying to balance our food-obsessed culture with a grain free diet and lifestyle is hard, but possible.","Content":"<h2>Should I Go Grainless?</h2>\nThat’s a question many of us ask. What makes it harder sometimes is that American culture is not very accepting of a grain free life.   Whether focusing just on gluten or grains in general, it’s hard to balance our food-obsessed culture with a grain free diet and lifestyle.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>So how do you decide?</h3>\nLet me tell you how I made the decision.\n\nI found myself being irritable, constantly tired, moody, dealing with headaches, and unable to lose weight despite following “the right plan.” In talking with a friend about her challenges, I decided going gluten-free was a step that might show some results.\n\nGluten-free eating helped me feel better for a while, but then I started getting sick again. This time I had achy joints and bones, sensitivity to touch, intensely painful stomachaches and heartburn. <em><strong>Unfortunately, I never knew what was causing these symptoms.</strong></em>\n\nI also started dealing with high levels of anxiety that affected my energy and attitude at work. I began exploring what these issues could relate to and between talking to a friend of my parents who has severe allergies and reading articles written by <a href=\"http://www.thepaleomom.com\">The Paleo Mom</a>, I realized going Paleo could be the right choice for me. If you felt any shred of the desperation I felt at this time my life, you'll relate to the sentiment that \"You'll try anything (reasonable) to feel better.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI started a <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/nutrition_hacks/get-started-paleo-diet/\">Paleo</a> lifestyle and began to feel better. This was by choice, but when it stopped working, I had to ask why.\n\nThus, I sought out a functional medicine doctor who spent 90 minutes with me talking about my life and medical issues. She also had me do about 35 lab tests and a DNA analysis through which an answer was found! The prognosis was not idea., but the first step to healing what knowing my ailments.\n\nI had a leaky gut, but was also sick with multiple infections aka <a href=\"http://www.thepaleomom.com/2012/07/modifying-paleo-small-intestinal.html\">Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)</a>.I was fortunate enough to have good health insurance and enough salary to afford the functional medicine doctor.\n\nHowever, not everyone can do that. So how do you determine if a Paleo lifestyle is by choice or necessitated? I initially knew I potentially had a leaky gut and/or an autoimmune disease through an extensive amount of reading and research:<img class=\"alignright wp-image-5258 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog-image.happygut-e1434468846455-300x193.jpg\" alt=\"grain-free--happy-gut\" width=\"300\" height=\"193\" />\n<ul>\n\t<li>Digestive issues? Check.</li>\n\t<li>Mood swings?</li>\n\t<li>Check. Restless Legs?</li>\n\t<li>Check. And so on.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nAccording to Dr. Amy Meyers, there are <a href=\"http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-8843/10-signs-you-have-an-autoimmune-disease-how-to-reverse-it.html\">10 signs</a> you may exhibit if you have an autoimmune disorder (i.e. need to look at your diet, specifically gluten &amp; grains):\n<ol>\n\t<li>Joint pain, muscle <a href=\"http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-8843/null/tag/pain.html\">pain</a> or weakness or a tremor</li>\n\t<li>Weight loss, insomnia, heat intolerance or rapid heartbeat</li>\n\t<li>Recurrent rashes or hives, sun-sensitivity, a butterfly-shaped rash across your nose and cheeks.</li>\n\t<li>Difficulty concentrating or focusing</li>\n\t<li>Feeling tired or fatigued, weight gain or cold intolerance</li>\n\t<li>Hair loss or white patches on your skin or inside your mouth</li>\n\t<li>Abdominal pain, blood or mucus in your stool, diarrhea or mouth ulcers</li>\n\t<li>Dry eyes, mouth or skin</li>\n\t<li>Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet</li>\n\t<li>Multiple miscarriages or blood clots</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Does this sound like you?</h3>\nThe best action I've found is to start taking inflammatory food items out of your diet. This includes:\n<ul>\n\t<li>gluten/grains,</li>\n\t<li>dairy,</li>\n\t<li>soy, and</li>\n\t<li>processed foods.</li>\n</ul>\nIt’s also beneficial to eat grass-fed meat and organic produce. Sometimes these items can be cost-prohibitive, <em><strong>so there is a <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/health/the-dirty-dozen-and-clean-15-of-produce/616/\">list</a> of the dirty dozen and clean 15 organic produce to guide your shopping.</strong></em>\n\nWhen I was told by my doctor that I was to avoid corn, soy, rice, sugar, dairy, peanuts, and gluten, I knew I could no longer be a “as I felt like it” Paleo eater.\n\nWhile her list was shorter in restrictions, I kept to the way I had been eating and have stayed away from all grains – not just gluten, corn, &amp; rice. Further, the gums (xantham, guar, &amp; carrageenan) can be inflammatory so I’ve avoided those as well.\n\nUnfortunately, they are in most store-bought items. It’s been exhilarating and frustrating all at the same time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The Ugly:</strong> Eating out with my friends isn’t what it used to be, but I can invite them to have food at my house. At the same time though, I LOVE to cook and bake and have challenged myself to keep a contamination-free kitchen and to create meals and treats that even the biggest gluten and sugar lover (aka...my mother) will like.\n\nAt first I used cookbooks to learn how prepare grainless food. Now I'm successfully creating my own <img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5259\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Grainless-Logo-300x101.jpg\" alt=\"Grainless Logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"101\" />recipes – which has led me to start my own business – <a href=\"http://www.grainlessgourmet.net\">Grainless Gourmet</a>.

If you agree that having food restrictions doesn’t mean you want to be less social or enjoy food less, we'll get along just fine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Food Allergies &amp; Health Choices = Seeking equally delicious foods within certain parameters</em>\n\nDo you have grain and gluten questions?\n\nLeave a comment below or email me, Kelly Lough, at <a href=\"mailto:grainlessgourmet@gmail.com\">grainlessgourmet@gmail.com</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;","Slug":"grain-free-diet-the-good-bad-and-ugly","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/grain-free-diet-the-good-bad-and-ugly/","Path":"/interesting_other/grain-free-diet-the-good-bad-and-ugly/","Date":"2015-06-16","Year":"2015","Month":"06","Day":"16","Categories":"Health Tips | Interesting Other | Lifestyle Design | Nutrition Hacks | Success stories","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/grain-free-cauliflower-crust.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Grainless-Logo.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog-image.happygut-e1434468846455.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/grain-free-cauliflower-crust.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Grainless-Logo.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog-image.happygut-e1434468846455.jpg","Image Alt Text":"grain-free-cauliflower-crust"},{"id":"5260","Title":"How to Race to Thrive with Nell Stephenson","Meta Description":"Today as I review my latest triathlon race results, I reflect on what has led me to the 2015 IRONMAN World Championships.","Content":"<h2>The More I Race, The More I Learn</h2>\nNot just about how best to mentally prepare or what strategies to employ, but about myself. Today as I review my latest triathlon race results, I reflect on what has led me to the 2015 IRONMAN World Championships.\n\nIt's not always been so obvious that Triathlons give me chances to discover what things I allow to serve as motivators to dig deeper and push harder than I had before. I experience a very direct result of my training on a race course, and I find myself attempting to discern which tactics might have the opposite effect and result in more of a road block, at least until I can sort them out and turn those into a launching pad for further growth and progress in their own right.\n\nWhat we learn about our limitations and capabilities in sport carries through into every other aspect of a person's life, which is yet one more reason why I feel so passionate about educating on the significance on getting moving from an early age, just as much as eating properly.\n\n[Tweet \"The winner's brain simply doesn't give in.\"]\n\nLooking back over the last decade at myself as an athlete, I can vividly recall being in particular states of mind while getting ready for a race (not all ideal) and how difficult it was to learn how to work through them and come out a more tenacious athlete.\n\n<strong>My goal: set new physical limits. </strong>\n\nI did not want to give up one iota of competitiveness or desire to perform past prior limits. There was what I’d call a beginner’s mindset. I had this mindset for quite a while where I my goal was more to manage completing a race as opposed to doing so in a certain time. At this stage of my running life, I made rookie mistakes which we all do in terms of poor nutrition protocol and improper training.\n\n[Tweet \"What we learn about our limitations and capabilities in sport has a powerful effect on all other aspects of our life.\"]\n\n<em><strong>Then came the stage...</strong></em>in which I first learned the significance of mental preparation and learned of the work of Tim Naokes: \"My unproven hypothesis is that in the case of a close finish, physiology does not determine who wins. Rather somewhere in the final section of the race, the brains of the second, and lower placed finishers, accept their respective finishing positions and no longer challenge for a higher finish.\" The winner's brain simply doesn't give in.<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>\n\nAround the same time, I began dating my now husband, who at the time had transitioned from being a successful marathon runner and fellow IRONMAN triathlete into ultra-running.\n\nFrom those two inputs, I began to learn how to mentally prepare not just for an event, but for training as well. I began to test calming my usual negative reaction to a high heart rate (which would occur when I began to push the pace during a run) and not to dwell on what might go wrong in a race.\n\nIn a nutshell, it became clear that while we obviously need to put in the time to physically prepare for a race, to not equally prepare mentally could easily result in a day sabotaged by worry, doubt, poor focus and a disappointing outcome.\n\nRoger Bannister, the first runner to break the four-minute mile, once said: “It is the brain, not the heart or lungs that is the critical organ. It’s the brain.”<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a>\n\nFrom this intermediate racer stage,  a good five years followed during which my race performance began to improve significantly and I began to regularly place in the top three.\n\nSometimes I would even win my age group, but with that came a self imposed level of stress about the performance which resulted in extraordinarily high levels of anxiety and catastrophic fear of something going wrong during the race.\n\nIt was as if not winning would have been the end all.\n\nFortunately, the stress wasn’t so out of hand that it worked against me and I continued to be able to perform. Still, the emotional wringer I’d put myself through each and every race made the days leading up to it less than pleasant, to say the least.\n\nIt was downright awful.\n\nIt was actually at this very race that I'm at now (in 2015), the Ironman Hawaii 70.3, when I had my breakthrough on that front.\n\nIt was 2009. I had landed in Kona and the race was coming up a few days later. I’d already begun to feel that uncomfortable churning in my stomach and worrying about the cross winds, flatting on the bike, which might cost me a win and blah, blah, blah...\n\nThe stress was bubbling just below the point of overwhelming as the race was still a few days away.\n\nAnd then, as if by magic, the next morning when I woke to a beautiful morning in paradise, it dawned on me how lucky I was. It sounds simple; Scenery provokes some powerful moods. (Hawaii tourism--here's your new bumper sticker, but I digress.)\n\nThere I was in Hawaii, with my husband, about to have a chance to race in one of the most special places in the world.\n\n<strong>And if, for some reason, I didn’t win my age group and earn a slot to World Championships, would it really be the end of everything?</strong>\n\nThis wasn’t to say that I no longer cared about the outcome; rather, just that it took the tiniest bit of pressure off and allowed me to reallocate what would have been wasted energy into positive thought processes.\n\n<strong>And I preformed better than I had before.</strong>\n\nSo this, all of it, has been part of my own growth as an athlete.\n\nAnd when I sit down to write a race report, I do think it’s fun, perhaps, to share time splits, wattage goals, when I chose to surge on the bike and who had a target on their back for me to pick off during the run; those things all seem less important than the bigger picture.\n\nIt was indeed a great day at the races; hot yes, and some wind (of course because when is there not some wind in Kona?) and I had a solid plan that I'd thoroughly reviewed with my coach the day before.\n\nA new swim strategy, a higher wattage output on the bike a new pacing goal for the run all proved to be successful in my result of an age group win and 4<sup>th</sup> woman overall.\n\nI’m also incredibly proud of Chris, my husband, who also had a great race winning his slot for IM 70.3 World Championships in Austria. We will both race this August.\n\nI gave it everything, worked hard throughout each second of the course and am now ready for a couple of days of R&amp;R, which shouldn’t be too hard given the surroundings!\n\nAs I’ve written before, there’s just something incredibly special about being here on this island that goes beyond the spoken word; a feeling of being part of something bigger.\n\nAnd I feel honored to be a part of it.\n\nAloha!\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"></a>\n\n<hr />\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> \"Tim Noakes on Fatigue, Cowardice, Winners and Losers.\" <em>Runner's World</em>.

How to go from spectator to qualifier.","Content":"<h2>My Journey from IRONMAN Spectator to Qualifier</h2>\n<h2></h2>\nI’m writing this live from the big island today and I’m back to race one of my favorite courses, Ironman Hawaii 70.3, which will take place tomorrow at 7am local time.\n\nIn years past, this course has served as my qualifier for Ironman World Championships (Worlds), held each year in October just south of where tomorrow’s event will take place, with portions of the bike on the very same route on Queen K then out to Hawaii and back.\n\nDue to a change in which races can serve this capacity, it’s no longer an option to win one’s slot to Kona here, but athletes from all walks of life can opt to have a go at what is, in my opinion, one of the best half-ironman races out there.\n\nQualifying for the IRONMAN World Championship is extraordinarily difficult. Just completing one of the 40 full-distance races around the world requires courage, perseverance and dedication. For some, the goal will be to earn a slot to the 70.3 Worlds held this year in Austria and for others the mission may be to complete their very first half. For others still, it’s simply as straightforward as a very enjoyable place to take a vacation with just a little bit of exercise peppered right in the middle!\n\nIf triathlon doesn’t happen to be your thing, here are some reference points:\n<ul>\n\t<li>The race consists of a 1.2 mile swim, followed by a 56 mile bike ride and then a half marathon, which is a run of 13.1 miles</li>\n\t<li>Over 2200 entries raced the Kona half IRONMAN course in 2014</li>\n\t<li>Earning a IRONMAN qualifying spot puts you among the world's endurance elite; <a href=\"http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/news/articles/2015/03/kona-qualifying.aspx#axzz3cUFLqBye\" target=\"_blank\">only three percent of age group athletes qualify for Kona.</a></li>\n</ul>\nThis will be my 7<sup>th</sup> Honu (as it’s locally known) and 2015 marks my 18<sup>th</sup> in the sport; my very first tri being the sprint in Catalina back in 1998, where I committed more than one newbie blunder, the silliest of which was forgetting to take my helmet off during the run!\n\nBack then, my reason for racing was simply that I wanted a fun reason to workout, something less stressful than wanting to keep at a certain weight regardless of how that end might be met.\n\nI recall a college friend at the time asking me if I’d ever race Ironman and my reply, without missing a beat, was that I’d never in a million years be able to do something like that!\n\nLittle did I know that a mere two years later, I’d change my tune in a big way.\n\n[Tweet \"I never in a million years thought I could race an IRONMAN, but two years later I changed my tune in a big way. -Paleoista\"]\n\nI’d gone to spectate the <a href=\"http://www.ironmancalifornia.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ralphs California Half IRONMAN</a>, which in its first two years was a full.   A good friend was racing and I cheered her through her outstanding performance and then chose to carry on watching the other athletes cross the finish line.\n\nI saw many a fit-looking person run through the tape, embracing a loved one or kissing the ground in sheer delight for what they’d just accomplished.\n\nThat was exciting enough but it was what came next that would change my approach on training, racing and affect my life as an athlete in a way more profound than I ever could have dreamed.\n\nI saw an athlete cross the finish line in his wheel chair. And I saw a gentleman (Bill Bell), who was over 80 years old at the time, finish as well. And another athlete with a prosthetic leg. And an athlete who was blind with his guide!\n\nI couldn’t believe what I was seeing and to this day, even now as I write this, I feel chills down my spine and tears in my eyes when I imagine what their day to day life must be like on its own, let alone the courage it must take to decide to take on the challenge of an IRONMAN race.\n\nThat was my moment.\n\nI realized hard and fast that the idea that “I couldn’t” do that was asinine. There I was, not even 25 years old yet, with a healthy body thinking I couldn’t.\n\n[Tweet \"I realized hard and fast that the idea that “I couldn’t” do <em>that</em> was asinine. -Paleoista\"]\n\nSo I knew I had to do it and the very next day I signed up for what would be my first Ironman, the 2001 IM California.\n\nThe rest may be history, but since then, I’ve experienced so much, from the years I still had to work through the terrible sickness that led me to <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/5-paleo-pointers-for-well-rounded-results/\" target=\"_blank\">Paleo</a>, to the wonderful people I met through the sport including dear friends, and my husband, to what the sport provided me then and continues to provide me today: an exciting, exhilarating, incredible mode of training, racing, competing and most importantly, a chance to continue to push myself beyond limits for no other reason than “why not”?\n\nI’ve probably told this story about a million times, and my reason for sharing it is not that I think everyone needs to be an ironman.\n\nIt’s because I think we all need a reality check sometimes and it takes something significant to give us some perspective. For me, Ralphs California racers gave me that wakeup call.\n\nConsider yourself: what are you doing to take full advantage of the fact that you have a choice in the matter of how you treat your body?\n\nThere really are no excuses, and the goal I’d have for anyone reading this post is to remember one thing: you’ve got only one body and you can choose to treat it as the proverbial temple by moving it and nourishing it with real food. Or you can choose not to.   If you choose the former, outstanding! Conversely, if you choose the latter, that’s certainly an option as well, but make sure you factor in what you’re taking for granted.\n\nSo as far as tomorrow’s race is concerned, have I got goals?\n\nDo I want to smash my times and those of my competitors as well? Of course! I love some healthy competition and I love seeing how I can improve my own times year on year.\n\nI’ve experienced it all on this course- from 2007 when I punctured my tubular so badly it couldn’t be ridden 9 miles out from T2 and lost over twenty minutes waiting for support, to 2010 when I raced my guts out and came across the line as the first female amateur.\n\n[Tweet \"How will you take full advantage of the fact that it's a matter of choice how you treat your body?\"]\n\nI have learned, and I continue to learn so much from this sport and it carries over into other parts of my life. This is just another reason I am so keen to recommend sport as something to engage in to <a href=\"http://www.paleoista.com/services-2/\" target=\"_blank\">my clients</a> as well as children of clients (all ages). I'm ready to share my IRONMAN 101 story to inspire the same transformation in their lives.\n\nIn particular, there’s just something very special about racing on this island.\n\nWhether it’s the fact that these are the hallowed grounds where the big show takes place each year, the warm, welcoming culture or the lure of the tales of the island gods, it’s an honor to be here each and every time and I look forward to a day in which I am present each and every second.\n\nMuch respect.\n\nAloha!\n\n<hr />\n\n<em>The race has now ended but to watch the 2015 race replay, visit <a href=\"http://www.ironmanlive.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.ironmanlive.com</a></em>","Slug":"ironman-101-a-qualifier-experience-explained","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/ironman-101-a-qualifier-experience-explained/","Path":"/interesting_other/ironman-101-a-qualifier-experience-explained/","Date":"2015-06-09","Year":"2015","Month":"06","Day":"09","Categories":"Interesting Other | Performance Advice","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/triathlon-bike-transition.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ironman-triathlon-bike-transition.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iStock_000017206254_Large.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/triathlon-bike-transition.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ironman-triathlon-bike-transition.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iStock_000017206254_Large.jpg","Image Alt Text":"triathlon-race-bike-transition | ironman-triathlon-bike-transition | "},{"id":"5266","Title":"Pacing for Performance: 1 Training Tip to Start ASAP","Meta Description":"Do you know how to pace in a race, or has the wind left your sails by the finish line? Condition your body to end stronger with negative splits running.","Content":"<h2>To find your optimal cadence, start with negative splits running</h2>\nTo start, answer these two questions if you can:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Do you know what your race pace is?</li>\n\t<li>Do you find yourself crashing on the second half of a course or race?</li>\n</ul>\nIn my lifetime of OCR racing, one of the biggest mistakes I see people make during races is misjudging their own pace. This is a very important part of running and ultimately dooms many newbies in the sport.\n\nEvery race, without fail, I see people that jump out to the front of the pack and lead the race for 400 meters only to finish in 80th place. Running is one of those sports where you can’t play defense. You can’t stop a guy that’s faster than you, its just not allowed. Maybe one day we will have a full contact obstacle course race (which I would absolutely be a fan of), but until then it’s a good idea to find out what your pace is.\n\n<em>I pride myself on finishing races strong and it has a lot to do with my training. </em>\n\nI always try to have negative splits during my running days. <strong>Negative splits running</strong> is when your repeats get faster as you get into your workout. For example, I did a workout where I did 4 x 1 mile repeats down on the East River in NYC with a 30 burpees in between each mile and about 90 seconds of rest. But my mile times were: mile 1 6:49, mile 2 6:38, mile 3 6:25, mile 4 5:55. <em>You see my pace increased as the workout went along.</em> First mile was my slowest and the last was my fastest, that’s what negative splits are and it’s a great way to get faster and become a more efficient runner.\n\nOur goal here is to teach the body to become faster as opposed to slowing down as the race goes along.\n\nMany people go out at a pace that they can’t handle and end up crashing hard and struggle to finish the race. It’s happened to everyone, including myself. Now when I line up at the start line and see guys that are much faster than me I don’t try and keep up with them, instead I go out at my pace and maintain that pace for the entire race. They will go out of the gate at a pace that I won’t be able to sustain and if I try and run with them I will inevitably crash halfway through the race. Again this is why it’s important to know your pace and go at a pace that you can handle.\n\nDon’t think I’m telling you to run slow or not push hard, but when you’re heading out on an 10 mile course, you can’t go out at your 5k pace. <em>You have to be smart, realistic and aim to have a solid race start to finish.</em>\n\nThe goal of a good race for me is to maintain a consistent pace and have a nice kick at the end. You will be surprised how many people you will pass during the second half of a race. Most people will run much slower during the second half of the race, so even though they may jump out ahead of you, don’t panic.\n\nKeep your pace and when they start crashing you’ll start passing.\n<h3><strong>Final advice:</strong></h3>\nI encourage all of you to start incorporating this negative split theory into your weekly workouts. It can be on quarter mile splits or mile splits or any distance. Get to know yourself a bit better by timing your runs and getting to know your pace so when race day comes you can have a strong race start to finish.\n\nAny questions or workout advice?

To enjoy, learn good snacking habits.","Content":"<h2>Master the Grazing Game With Effective Tactics</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nWe have all heard the nagging weight control adage: \"Don't snack between meals!\" It's like a tug of guilt on our heartstrings as we reach for that afternoon cookie, those midnight crackers. But we are living, moving, fuel-burning creatures–snacking has become our nature in a fast-paced environment. It is unrealistic to live our lives according to the modern world's hours of operation.\n\nThree-Squares are a thing of the past.\n\nThat being said, it is actually very realistic to snack on foods throughout the day that provide you nutrient-rich body and brainpower. Proteins, omegas, and antioxidants are natural performance enhancers when consumed in small portions throughout the day. They are the nutrients that are lacking when low energy strikes. But are you enjoying the benefits of good snacking habits?\n\nUse some of these easy tips for constructing new eating routines.\n<h3>1.) Anticipate For A Time Crunch</h3>\nIf you're like me, you're not sure what the day will throw at you! Our best-laid plans may go awry, and in this event we want to be prepared for a grab-n-go mini meal. Stock your fridge with plastic baggies full of fresh veggies, fruits, and nuts to avoid last minute hassles. Vacuum seal small portions of meat or fish for much needed protein boosts.\n\nNot a meat-eater? Hard-boiled eggs, various seeds, and natural energy bars are always quick and easy when kept well stocked. Munching on these will curb the urge to succumb to the gnawing hunger that leads to a stop off at the drive-thru.\n<h3>2.) Indulge, With Caution</h3>\nThis means rationing. Give yourself a break if you can't bear the temptation. It's OK! We're human! We sin. We eat junk food sometimes. Our bodies are actually craving two things when our mouths water for sweets.\n\nFirst, of course, is the taste of something delectable. Our senses trigger our brain into sending signals that we have a craving. Our first instinct is to satisfy these cravings, and by doing so, we over-indulge at times. However it is merely the taste of something that we are wanting. Those sweets do nothing for our systems and our bodies know it. A few bites of that \"chocolate cake\" is all that craving really needs to feel appeased.\n\nSecond, the much more powerful thing our bodies are asking for during a sweets craving is more protein. We burn through the stuff like mad throughout the day and the most dangerous thing to be near when we're running on fumes is a bowl full of Hershey's kisses. -Best to keep a bowl full of almonds within reach instead :)\n<h3>3.) Trade Fillers For Stabilizers</h3>\nSimply put, we don't win marathons on a belly full of bread. If you sat down to dinner with my grandparents, you'd most likely get your potato, your noodles, your frozen-then-steamed peas, and don't forget the random plate of sliced bread (alongside a tub of margarine, for full disclosure here). Sure you're walking away from the table with a full stomach. What about an hour or so later? When you’re lethargic, cranky and hungry again–and its only 8pm?\n\nNo disrespect to my grandparents' generation, but in relation to healthy eating, we have more options and more proven facts nowadays. Toss the barrage of grains and invest in freshness.\n\nWe need grass-fed meats, fresh fish, raw vegetables and fruits within season, and a selection of healthy fats and oils. It's what a real dinner should look like. Eating habits like this will even decrease your amount of snacking altogether!\n<h3>4.) Appeal To All Of Your Senses</h3>\nThat's right, all five of them! That inexplicable drooling you have when passing a TacoBell? That's really the salt that you smell and you don't even realize it. It’s the subconscious desire to crunch on those chips. Our brains link sound with satisfaction. The actual sound of crunching makes us want more...and more.... and more. And half the bag later... (Again, self-hatred ensues.)\n\nThese are just a few examples, but to counteract these desires that have your brain captivated, try munching on carrot sticks or a handful of nuts. Drink more fluids when getting the itch to eat salty foods. Get in front of the problem, learn what your body is actually asking for, and you'll soon train your senses to crave the good stuff.\n<h3>5.) Hydrate, Your Life Depends On It Anyway</h3>\nIt's common for people to mistake hunger for thirst. Dehydration is one of the leading factors for overeating, believe it or not. It's a silent killer for weight control, especially if you're not aware of your need for water consumption. Maintaining hydration will give you more sustained energy levels and reduce hunger pains between meals.\n\nThe rule of thumb is to drink eight 8oz glasses of water each day. This is a good starting off point, but keep in mind other items you ingest can give rise to dehydration levels, meaning you sometimes need to replace what's depleted. For every cup of caffeine or alcohol you consume, you will need to match it with a glass of water. This, is in addition to your average daily intake of water.\n\nThese tricks are just a few of the many ways to achieve success in healthy eating. Refueling can be necessary, but it doesn't have to be done at the doughnut counter. Grazing from an assortment of super foods and whole nutrients will propel you through that final stretch before you're able to sit down to the real meal.\n\nThe effects can be astonishing for those currently suffering from fatigue, hunger pains, and lethargy at various points between meals. Try it out! You should be pleased with the outcome.","Slug":"tricks-reinvent-good-snacking-habits","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/tricks-reinvent-good-snacking-habits/","Path":"/interesting_other/tricks-reinvent-good-snacking-habits/","Date":"2015-06-25","Year":"2015","Month":"06","Day":"25","Categories":"Health Tips | How To | Interesting Other | Nutrition Hacks","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/create-good-snacking-habits.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/create-good-snacking-habits.jpg","Image Alt Text":"create-good-snacking-habits"},{"id":"5319","Title":"Spicy Coconut Mayo","Meta Description":"A paleo taste of the tropics that's loaded with healthy fats and luscious flavor.

Plus, it's a sneaky-easy way to get an extra servings of vegetables; I love to eat a bowl alongside my breakfast.\n\nThanks to the texture of the zucchini, the soup is creamy and rich-tasting, without any dairy or coconut milk—and it's dead-easy to make. It's barely more complicated than tossing everything in a pot, forgetting about it for 45 minutes, then puréeing it with a blender.\n\nZip! Slurp!\n\n<strong>Silky Gingered Zucchini Soup</strong>\n<em>Prep 10 min | Cook 60 min | Serves 4-6 | Whole30 compliant</em>\n\n<strong>Ingredients:</strong>\n1 tablespoon coconut oil\n1/2 medium onion, chopped\n4 large cloves garlic, peeled\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon powdered ginger\n1 teaspoon ground coriander\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 pounds zucchini (about 4), chopped\n4 cups high-quality chicken broth (homemade bone broth is best!)\n\n<strong>Directions:</strong>\n1. Heat coconut oil in a large soup pot on medium heat, 2 minutes. Add onions, then smash garlic cloves with the flat side of a knife or the bottom of a glass and add to pan. Stir often and cook until the onions and garlic are soft and golden, but not browned, about 7 minutes. Add salt, ginger, and black pepper; stir to combine.\n\n2. Toss the zucchini into the pot. Stir to coat the zucchini with fat, then cook 'til beginning to soften, about 5 minutes.\n\n3. Add the broth, bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to simmer. Let the zucchini cook 45 to 60 minutes until it's very soft.\n\n4. VERY carefully, purée the zucchini and broth in a blender or food processor, or with an immersion blender. If you're using a blender, work in batches, filling the canister only halfway and holding a towel over the lid while you purée. Eat immediately, or store in a covered container in the fridge.\n\n<strong>Tasty garnishes:</strong> My favorite right now is dried or fresh chopped chives. The green tops of scallions are also yummy. You would not be remiss if you drizzled a little sesame oil across the top.","Slug":"silky-gingered-zucchini-soup","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/paleo-recipes/silky-gingered-zucchini-soup","Path":"/paleo-recipes/silky-gingered-zucchini-soup","Date":"2016-10-30","Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"30","Categories":"Paleo Recipes","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/silkygingeredzucchinisoup.png","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/silkygingeredzucchinisoup.png"},{"id":"5355","Title":"Fruit Gels Recipe","Meta Description":"This recipe describes how to make delicious fruit gels without the use of sugar in the ingredients.","Content":"<h2>Fruit gels everyone will enjoy</h2>\nAll my children are blessed with healthy appetites – they would usually eat anything I put in front of them, but like most kids, they were big fans of sugary treats. Dealing tooth ache and cavities is common for mothers, especially those like me, with more than one child. The best way to make sure they don’t miss out on eating sugary concoctions and not compromise on nutrition is to give them fruit treats.\n\nWhy have fruit gels?\n\nFruit gels don’t just taste yummy but also have a plethora of health benefits. Firstly, the recipe infuses the goodness of fresh fruit juice and provides the necessary nourishment. There is also a substance called acetylcholine in them that aids in strengthening the immune system of the body. Gels have been used to combat health conditions like ulcers, allergies, skin rashes &amp; irritation, and for liver &amp; kidney disorders. A few points to remember about fruit gels:\n<ul>\n\t<li>They contain high amounts of amino acids, including the 8 acids that aid in regulation of body functions.</li>\n\t<li>Gels promote overall growth and development.</li>\n\t<li>They are packed with fatty acids, folic acid, protein, Vitamin B and other nutrients.</li>\n\t<li>Aspartic acid is present in gels, which assists in growth of muscles, tissue, and cells.</li>\n\t<li>They have both antimicrobial and antibacterial properties.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Substituting sugar with Erythritol</strong>\n\nI usually stay away from sugar as I dedicatedly follow the Paleo diet, but anything in moderation doesn’t cause harm, which is why I have used it in this recipe. However, if you are an ardent believer in the no-sugar rule, I have suggested powdered erythritol as an alternative. It has less calories and carbs, and don’t impact blood sugar levels, thereby making it safe for both kids and adults. Erythritol is basically a sugar alcohol, which isn’t absorbed by the small intestine in small amounts as most of it passes into the bloodstream. The leftover is then ejected from the body via excretion. The best part is it doesn’t feed bacteria in the mouth, thus reducing chances of poor dental health.\n\nSince erythritol contains 70% of the sweetness of sugar, it doesn’t impact the overall taste – in fact you won’t be able to make out the difference. Fruit gels can be eaten at any time since they don’t lead to side effects. They can be taken with coconut whipped cream or slices of pineapple to enhance the flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReady to create this dish? <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-recipes/fruit-gels/\">View recipe here</a>","Slug":"fruit-gels","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/nutrition_hacks/fruit-gels/","Path":"/nutrition_hacks/fruit-gels/","Date":"2015-07-07","Year":"2015","Month":"07","Day":"07","Categories":"Nutrition Hacks | Paleo Recipes","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fruit-Trimmed.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fruit-Trimmed.jpg"},{"id":"5357","Title":"Braised Steak with Mustard","Meta Description":"Please your guests with this delicious braised steak with mustard","Content":"<h2>Bring a hit to your next home party or dinner</h2>\nIt is a total misconception that braised steak with mustard is a complicated recipe that requires hours – in fact it is just the opposite! There are about half a dozen main ingredients and preparation time is pretty quick. I have used salt and pepper for seasoning as well as Dijon mustard, which contained verjuice, the acidic green component of unripe grapes, in place of vinegar. Some varieties have white wine instead of verjuice these days.\n\n<strong>Know all about braising</strong>\n\nHere too, I will be using grass-fed products namely, flank-steak and butter as they are much healthier in terms of nutritional value. The cooking technique in this case is known as braising, which is often confused with stewing due to which both terms are used interchangeably. There are some similarities between the methods, but a few subtle differences as well. We have come a long way from when braising meant flinging what you wanted to eat in the fire, and letting it be until it was done. Braising involves simmering food in minute proportions of liquid in a pan or casserole. While stewing involves dip the ingredients in liquid, braising needs just enough water, wine or stock for a little moisture to soften the meat. However, the end result is the same – the ingredients are tenderized and flavors are more pronounced.\n\n<strong>Flavoring and how!</strong>\n\nI used red wine for my Irish beef stew, but have opted for a crisp white variety this time. It is believed that white wine is equally efficient as red when it comes to regulating heart function and preventing blockage of arteries. The antioxidant components in white wine, such as tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, are also quite powerful. Minced shallots also help to accentuate the taste, and offer numerous health benefits, which is why you should incorporate them into your daily diet. They act as antioxidants, promote heart health, improve blood circulation, regulate metabolism, reduce bad cholesterol, keep blood pressure in check, etc.\n\n<strong>Serving tips</strong>\n\nThis braised steak can be served with a generous sprinkling of coriander on top, and sweet potato fries &amp; roasted vegetables on the side. If you feel this combination is too filling, go for lightly toasted garlic bread or mashed potatoes. Garnishing with peppercorns is fine as long as you enjoy their distinctive taste and aroma. To enhance the tangy flavor of the steak, you can serve it with some spicy chips!\n\nJuicy, delicious braised steak with a glass of wine for dinner – how does it sound?\n\nReady to create this dish?<a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-recipes/venison-steaks-paleo-style/\"> View recipe here</a>","Slug":"braised-steak-with-mustard","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/braised-steak-with-mustard/","Path":"/interesting_other/braised-steak-with-mustard/","Date":"2015-08-05","Year":"2015","Month":"08","Day":"05","Categories":"Interesting Other | Nutrition Hacks | Paleo Recipes","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Braised-Steak-Recipe.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Braised-Steak-Recipe.jpg"},{"id":"5358","Title":"Cauliflower Crust Pizza","Meta Description":"Surprise your taste buds with this delicious cauliflower crust pizza","Content":"<h2>Surprise yourself with this delicious cauliflower crust pizza!</h2>\nOriginally I added cauliflower mainly to vegetable stews or noodles. The usage of this vegetable in my kitchen was completely conventional until I came across this innovative pizza recipe. Initially I was apprehensive about a cauliflower crust, but judging by the responses of my friends and family, and also after tasting it myself, I can ashamedly admit I was missing out on one of the most delectable pizzas out there!\n\n<strong>Meat quality is crucial…</strong>\n\nI would really like to draw your attention to the types of meat I have used. Proscuitto, which is cured ham made from the hind leg of a pig, is consumed as is. It is already blended with salt (and a few spices at times), but I would suggest that you fry it a bit beforehand as it provides a better finishing touch and brings out the aroma even more strongly. As for chicken sausages, I prefer to make them at home as it is both safer and healthier, which means I won’t have to obsesses about the ingredients!\n\n<strong>Why opt for hormone-free meat?</strong>\n\nA couple of hormone-free meat products are a part of the recipe as well – Canadian bacon and pepperoni – the latter being particularly vital for the pizza. Before buying, check for the USDA Organic Seal to verify if a certain product is hormone-free. I was terrified to read to about the devastating side effects caused after consuming meat full of growth inducing hormones fed to animals, which severely deteriorated the quality of meat. It is absolutely necessary to use meat products sans hormones whenever possible. To put it in a nutshell, here’s why you should switch to organic meat:\n<ul>\n\t<li>The meat is natural and pure.</li>\n\t<li>Officially certified by the USDA to be safe and healthy.</li>\n\t<li>The more organic products in the food chain, the better it is for the environment.</li>\n\t<li>It won’t take a toll on your health because there are no harmful chemicals and hormones in it.</li>\n</ul>\nI used garlic powder because it tastes almost like the vegetable but doesn’t contain the harsh and caramel-like undertones. The powdered form is a slightly sweeter version too. One of the biggest advantages of this pizza is that it uses cauliflower as the base of the dough, thus preventing the carb overload of its traditional counterpart. If you prefer pizza with a spicy tang, sprinkle a generous amount of chilly flakes, cayenne seasoning or hot pepper on top. Hope you enjoy the pizza!\n\nReady to create this dish?  <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-recipes/paleo-pizza-gluten-free-nut-free-cauliflower-crust-pizza/\">View recipe here</a>","Slug":"cauliflower-crust-pizza","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/cauliflower-crust-pizza/","Path":"/interesting_other/cauliflower-crust-pizza/","Date":"2015-10-01","Year":"2015","Month":"10","Day":"01","Categories":"Interesting Other | Paleo Recipes","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/paleo-glutenfree-pizza3.png","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/paleo-glutenfree-pizza3.png"},{"id":"5406","Title":"Gluten-Free Tabbouleh","Content":"<h2>Gluten-Free Tabbouleh</h2>\nI got to know about the authentic Tabbouleh salad, from a few of my friends who ate and loved it. Being the food buff I am, I immediately started researching the recipe. I am all for using fresh herbs and vegetables, and the lemony kick appealed to me too, as I enjoy the citrus tang in foods, but the Bulghur wheat was a hurdle. Being an avid follower of Paleo, I wouldn’t use it, so I tweaked the recipe here and there and came up with my own version of this Middle Eastern salad.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The goodness of cauliflower…</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlthough I have used shredded cauliflower as the crust in my gluten-free pizza recipe, I didn’t touch upon the amazing health benefits of this vegetable. Since it is a member of cruciferous family, you should also incorporate it in your daily diet as it is packed with nutrients. It is also quite versatile – not only can you eat it raw, but it can be used in salads, soups, and various other forms of cooking. Cauliflower is useful in the following ways:\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>Combating cancer as it contains sulforaphane that destroys cancer stem cells.</li>\n\t<li>Both blood pressure and kidney function get a significant boost.</li>\n\t<li>Cauliflower is infused with anti-inflammatory nutrients that control inflammation and prevent repercussions on overall health.</li>\n\t<li>Antioxidants and phytonutrients stop organ and tissue damage by killing free radicals.</li>\n\t<li>It flushes out toxins and harmful chemicals from the body.</li>\n\t<li>Improves functionality of the brain and supports the digestive system with its dietary fibers.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Why use green onions?</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you are health conscious like yours truly, then green onions or scallions must have made their way into kitchen already! Although they have the same pungent flavor like white onions, they are milder, and don’t tamper with the overall taste of the dish. Moreover, they are low in calories so having a portion of these onions on a daily basis can help to maintain proper body weight. They also contain vitamin A, lutein and zeaxanthin, which positively impact your eyesight. You can eat green onions by adding to mixed salads like whole-wheat couscous, diced mango and jalapeno, and fresh cilantro, or in wraps and sandwiches.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMint is the surprise ingredient that adds its special touch as it helps in digestion, which is why mint tea is sometimes used for hangovers. Tabbouleh should be ideally served on a lettuce or cabbage bed with a side of French Fries – I am sure you will love it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGet recipe <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-recipes/paleo-gluten-free-tabbouleh/\">HERE</a>","Slug":"gluten-free-tabbouleh","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/gluten-free-tabbouleh/","Path":"/interesting_other/gluten-free-tabbouleh/","Date":"2015-10-05","Year":"2015","Month":"10","Day":"05","Categories":"Interesting Other | Paleo Recipes","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tabbouleh-650x787.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tabbouleh-650x787.jpg"},{"id":"5409","Title":"Irish Beef Stew","Content":"<h2>Irish Beef Stew</h2>\nYou don’t have to be a connoisseur of food to whip up something delectable. At times, a simple and wholesome recipe is what does the trick, as it can be incredibly tasty and quickly become one of the most loved comfort foods in your family. For instance, think back to those days, when mothers and grandmas would cook a large pot of warm stew for the whole family on a cold, wintery day, with the tantalizing aroma spreading all over the house – it was a simple meal, which was everyone’s favorite.\n\n<strong>The good old days…</strong>\n\nAlthough the concept of Paleo wasn’t much prevalent back then, you can cook good and hearty meals for your family based on this idea. A classic Irish beef stew is just what every family needs on a cold or rainy day when temperatures are low. Just imagine sitting around a crackling fire and spending time with your loved ones while sampling the stew – sounds great, right? This stew is suitable for kids too as it is extremely nutritious and will be in their tummies in no time, if you serve it to them when they come home from school or playing outdoors.\n\n<strong>Healthy and scrumptious</strong>\n\nBeef stew has several variations - some prefer it with more vegetables in large quantities while others might choose to experiment with the flavor by adding a few slices of an apple (yes that’s right!). I have used cubed carrots and potatoes, along with chopped garlic and onions. My objective was to create nutrient dense dish that is both tasty and healthy, which I have thankfully achieved. This stew is high on vitamins and minerals, and low on calories, so health buffs can consume it without counting calories in their minds!\n\n<strong>The role of red wine…</strong>\n\nTo bring out the essence of the stew, I have added a cup of red wine since it helps to flavor and moisten the meat and vegetables while simmering. Being an acidic substance, red wine contains a lot of tang, which greatly aids the cooking process. In fact, it is used in some cakes for these very reasons – in place of fat it makes the cake light and adds on some complimentary flavors as well.\n\nSome good old-fashioned style cooking is definitely on the cards on chilly fall and winter evenings! The stew should ideally be served with breadsticks, or a light rice dish. If you opt for the latter, go easy on the dessert. Garlic bread also works as does its crusty variety, which you can break into bite-sized pieces and eat by dipping into the thick gravy!\n\nView Recipe <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-recipes/tinas-irish-beef-stew/\">HERE!</a>\n\n&nbsp;","Slug":"irish-beef-stew","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/irish-beef-stew/","Path":"/interesting_other/irish-beef-stew/","Date":"2015-11-05","Year":"2015","Month":"11","Day":"05","Categories":"Interesting Other | Paleo Recipes","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Irish-Beef-Stew.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Irish-Beef-Stew.jpg"},{"id":"5411","Title":"Momma's Beef Short Ribs","Content":"<h2>Momma's Beef Short Ribs</h2>\nSoft succulent short ribs – my mouth starts watering right away! What is even better is the fact that this extremely appetizing dish can be done in a Paleo-friendly manner as well. Just like my Irish beef stew; this also is cooked by sautéing with a variety of vegetables to ensure there is no shortage of nutrients, while your taste buds experience the juicy flavor.\n\n<strong>Why use grass-fed beef?</strong>\n\nIn this recipe, I have used grass-fed beef short ribs for the meat. The nutrient composition of beef relies heavily on the feeding habits of cows. Cattle are often provided an unnatural diet based on corn and soy, which completely spoils the balance of saturated fat and cholesterol in their bodies. This type of beef is known as grain-fed beef and it is best to steer clear of it, since it doesn’t provide much in terms of nutrition. Grain feeding is usually done to fatten up the cows. On the other hand, beef from grass-fed cattle is much healthier because the process is completely natural and uncontaminated. Compared to its grain-fed counterpart, the grass-fed variety has the following benefits:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Contains more Vitamin A and E.</li>\n\t<li>Almost zero percent chance of contracting Mad Cow’s disease.</li>\n\t<li>Has almost 3 to 5 times more Conjugated Linoleic Acid content.</li>\n\t<li>Higher quantities of “good” saturated fats.</li>\n\t<li>Almost 2 to 4 times richer in omega-3 fatty acids, promoting heart health.</li>\n\t<li>Low in calories, which help to maintain proper body weight.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Rainbow chard or spinach?</strong>\n\nI have kept both avenues open! Rainbow chard can be used in so many ways – you can either eat them raw in salads or add it to gravy, soups and stews. The name is derived from the bright yellow, red, orange and purple stalks in each bunch of chard. It imparts a fresh zest to the beef short ribs, and is almost fat-free with low calorie count. Chards are mainly used as sources of Vitamin A and K, dietary fibers, phytochemicals, and iron. If you want to add spinach, that is a good option too, since it contains antioxidants, fatty acids, protein, phosphorus, vitamin E, zinc, and other nutrients.\n\nPay close attention during seasoning – add fresh cracked pepper in moderate amounts or else it might spoil the overall taste. Short ribs can be served with gluten-free polenta with chive flakes, roasted root vegetables, sautéed mushrooms (if you haven’t used it in the recipe), or bitter salads.\n\nSee Recipe <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-recipes/mommas-beef-short-ribs/\">HERE!</a>","Slug":"mommas-beef-short-ribs","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/mommas-beef-short-ribs/","Path":"/interesting_other/mommas-beef-short-ribs/","Date":"2015-12-05","Year":"2015","Month":"12","Day":"05","Categories":"Interesting Other | Paleo Recipes","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Short-Ribs-650x487.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Short-Ribs-650x487.jpg"},{"id":"5413","Title":"Paleo Brownie Pie Crust or Cookies","Content":"<h2>Paleo Brownie Pie Crust or Cookies</h2>\nWhat I really love about Paleo recipes is that they use healthy ingredients without any impact on the flavor or taste.

The raw beans are naturally infused with flavonoids, an antioxidant compound that improves overall health and lowers the risks of quite a few diseases. Flavonoids called anthocyanidin and epicatechins are powerful antioxidants present in large amounts. Basically, cacao should be incorporated into your diet because of the following reasons:\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>Antioxidants play an integral role in demolishing free radicals in tissues and cells. Free radicals wreak havoc upon your health, and by removing them, you get to enjoy robust health for a longer time. Antioxidants prevent platelet changes leading to blood clots and lessen inflammation.</li>\n\t<li>Flavonoids help to lower oxidation of bad cholesterol. High rates of oxidation lead to plaque, which causes atherosclerosis due to fats piling up in the arteries. More flavonoids in your system will improve blood circulation and reduce possibilities of heart disease.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Going nutty…</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAn ardent health freak like me is always looking to provide all round nourishment, which is why I have given you different options for adding nuts. Almonds are crucial though – it is one of the main ingredients, due to its unique flavor, which wonderfully accentuates the taste in this case. Sweet almonds are loaded with nutrients like Vitamin E and B2 and protein. They are instrumental in keeping you energized throughout the day, while reducing after-meal surges in blood sugar, thus protecting against cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.\n\nThe buttery essence and crunch feel of walnuts are ideal for adding to the crust. Not only are they delicious, but they also contain several components that are important to maintain optimum health. Similarly, you can use pecan nuts as well, since they have lots of monounsaturated fatty acids and phenolic antioxidants that boost good cholesterol. These nuts are also rich in minerals like manganese, potassium, calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, and selenium.\n\nThe best part is you can get creative with this recipe and tweak it to produce a different item each time.

But these pork ribs smoked at home have turned me into an avid pork eater due to their scrumptious taste!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Why use smoker bags?</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI found smoker bags to be very convenient – they useful in cooking traditional smoked food in a different way. Pork ribs prepared in this way are much healthier due to low-fat content. With a double-walled plastic bag, they can be easily put in the oven or grill, and all you have to do is seal the bags tightly so the smoke inside can’t escape. It is the smoke that enhances the taste and flavor of the pork ribs. Smoker bags also mean lesser cleanup afterwards as the ribs are served right out of the bag – no muss, no fuss! Here’s why you should buy smoker bags for smoked meals:\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>It takes just a few minutes for the food to get thoroughly cooked.</li>\n\t<li>They are free from glue and other chemicals.</li>\n\t<li>Easy to dispose – use and throw!</li>\n\t<li>No need to reverse sides of the food or the bag.</li>\n\t<li>Oven and grill is clean without sticky messes as in the case of conventional smoked dishes.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Serving suggestions</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can enjoy pork ribs even more by pairing them with interesting sides such as:\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>Spicy salad with black beans and avocado – you can also substitute avocado with potato.</li>\n\t<li>Snow pea and red onion salad with sesame vinaigrette.</li>\n\t<li>Pasta salad with asparagus and a hint of lemon to enhance the taste.</li>\n\t<li>Honey corn bread muffins – the sweetness plays delightfully against the succulent tang of ribs.</li>\n\t<li>Coleslaw sprinkled with caraway and raisins.</li>\n\t<li>Grilled zucchini with green onions and lemon.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nIn this recipe, I have used spare ribs instead of the baby back variety.

Take a look:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Boil and mash them instead of potatoes.</li>\n\t<li>Shred and add to any coleslaw recipe.</li>\n\t<li>Slow cooked roast can become tastier with cubed turnip.</li>\n\t<li>Chop or shred raw turnips to use as salad toppings.</li>\n\t<li>Add them to a soup or stew at the same time as putting in potatoes.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Fresh aroma of the seasonings…</strong>\n\nThe smell of parsley is so intoxicating! No wonder it used as seasoning for thousands of foods. It can complement herbs &amp; spices and also perk up the taste of grains &amp; pasta, which taste bland on their own. The slightly peppery flavor combined with a milder anise-like tang is why the parsley coating enhances the deliciousness of these fries. Since parsley is the parent of the plant family including caraway, cumin, celery, cilantro, chervil etc. it doesn’t hamper the individual flavors of these herbs.\n\nYou can serve these with barbecue sauce as its sweetness can play perfectly against the spices, or opt for a cream cheese dip!\n\nView Recipe <a href=\"http://www.paleomazing.com/paleo-recipes/spicy-turnip-fries/\">HERE!</a>","Slug":"spicy-turnip-fries","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/interesting_other/spicy-turnip-fries/","Path":"/interesting_other/spicy-turnip-fries/","Date":"2016-03-05","Year":"2016","Month":"03","Day":"05","Categories":"Interesting Other | Paleo Recipes","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Featured-Spicy-Turnip-Fries.-jpg-650x557.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Featured-Spicy-Turnip-Fries.-jpg-650x557.jpg"},{"id":"5530","Title":"Vikings Used Cod Liver Oil, Should You?","Meta Description":"The Superfood of Vikings, Cod Liver Oil.","Content":"We have been hearing a lot about cod liver oil being one of the dietary supplements that can do wonders to our health. But where did it come from, and what does it offer athletes?\n\nA bit of history first. Cod liver oil, taken from the livers of the Atlantic cod (hence, the name), was used as a food way back in the Viking Era. This raw oil was “highly valued for its powers of healing, strength, energy and stamina by the Vikings of Northern Norway.” Its first medical use was accounted for in 1789 when it was prescribed to a woman suffering from rheumatism, but it was only in 1822 when it was acknowledged for its healing powers.\n\nWhat nutrients does cod liver have that gives it its therapeutic properties?\n\n1. Omega-3 Fatty Acids - Cod liver oil contains huge amounts of EPA and DHA. These Omega-3s help burn fats and promote muscle growth. They are vital to brain and nervous system function. They regulate cholesterol levels in the body, which contributes to improved heart health.\n\n2. Vitamin A - Cod liver oil is a great source of the natural form of this important fat-soluble antioxidant. It helps prevent eye-related disorders, also supports brain health, and promotes healthy cellular growth. Aside from these, it stimulates hormone production that makes our body produce enzymes in active forms, which regulates our immune system.\n\n3. Vitamin D - Cod liver oil has plenty of this essential nutrient that is synthesized by the skin when exposed to the sun’s UV light. It strengthens neurotransmitter operations, heart health and inflammatory responses. It also supports bone metabolism and cell functions. It prevents depression, anxiety, fatigue and more.\n\nAll these nutrients work together to support athletic recovery and improve health in general. It is also important to note that cod liver oil contains a balanced amount of vitamin A and vitamin D, and that these natural nutrients always work together in allowing body processes to protect us from toxicity.\n\nAnd for athletes, taking cod liver oil as a dietary supplement will aid them in their trainings and workouts. Allowing them to push harder longer and recover quicker.\n\nWhat else? Cod liver oil supports bone health, and help prevent fractures and other injuries. It can also aid in healing skin wounds and in improving cardiovascular health.\n\nThere are many decent brands of cod liver oil available in the market today, but it is recommended to choose the one that uses the traditional oil fermenting method that guarantees the retention of more of the nutrients in their ideal ratio. Also you want to look for a wild caught variety from cold arctic waters as both vitamin A &amp; D and omega-3 contents are higher in this variety.\n\nOur cod liver oil is cold processed, fermented, and wild caught. Made from pure cod liver oil and designed with athletes in mind, as it improves recovery time, decreases post-workout inflammation, and reduces the risk of joint, soft tissue and tendon injuries. It is also the most rich in naturally occurring vitamin A and vitamin D when compared to any other brand on the market today. Sourced directly from Norway and encapsulated in a nitrogen rich vacuum environment to prevent oxidation (another problem found with less than premium brands).\n\nIf you are looking to increase your overall health and athletic performance  we encourage you to <strong><a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/products/cod-liver-oil/\">give our cod liver oil a try</a></strong>. Each bottle contains 60, 500-mg soft gel capsules, you take two per day so this is a 30 day supply.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our <strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B019G9NFDY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458502469&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=cod+liver&amp;m=&amp;tag=a0140b74-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cod liver formula is also available on Amazon</a></strong> and in a few short months it's accumulated <strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B019G9NFDY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458502469&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=cod+liver+oil&amp;m=&amp;tag=a0140b74-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">80+ five star reviews</a></strong>.

I have used it prior to performing a variety of exercises, such as Zumba, power lifting, and running.","Content":"<h1>Nitrate Rich Beet Juice Plays a Key Role in Endurance &amp; Performance</h1>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1>Do you call yourself an athlete?</h1>\nIf you are putting in work, maybe it's time you call yourself an athlete. Now, after a lot of work; I can proudly say that I call myself an athlete, I have never been dedicated to the idea of relying on supplements to fuel and enhance my activity. Whether it be for pre-, during, or post-workout, I just have not seen enough benefit of supplements. As a woman, my nutrition needs are not always addressed by a supplement product, aside from an occasional protein powder and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009S953YC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455125421&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=paleo+bars&amp;m=&amp;tag=a0140b74-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beloved paleo nutrition bars</a>.\n\nMost supplements do not interest me. Social media is ablaze with supplements toting increased energy, muscle recovery, and growth, and I only vaguely care. At one point, I found myself researching some of these supplements just to see what all the hype was about. I came across warnings such as, \"do not consume with coffee\" and \"may cause a tingling sensation.\"\n\nYikes! I immediately vowed to not try these supplements because they clearly came with some heavy side effects. Not cool.\n\nThat is, until recently when I began hearing more chatter around the benefits of nitrate rich beet powder. After some reading and searching, I tried <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJ6V0FC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455125568&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Beet+Nitrates&amp;m=&amp;tag=a0140b74-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beet Nitrates</a> from AMRAP.\n\nAMRAP's Beet Nitrate formula is freeze dried beetroot powder that, when mixed with water, can be used as an plant-based, Paleo-friendly, pre-workout drink. It is an endurance juice with simple easy-to-digest ingredients. There is nothing scary about this formula; beets, sea-salt, and stevia, and the payoff is big.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1> Why beets, you ask?</h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000039800446_Full.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5188\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000039800446_Full-300x240.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh juices - red beet, cabbage and carrot\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" /></a>Since beets are rich in Nitrates (NO3), the mix becomes absorbed into the bloodstream and is secreted into saliva. The bacteria in your mouth converts the Nitrates into Nitrite (NO2). When the NO2-rich saliva gets swallowed, the Nitrite is re-absorbed and loses oxygen to become Nitric Oxide (NO). The NO then boosts your stamina, which helps you exercise for an extended period of time and also improves blood flow and pressure. I've found that AMRAP's Beet Formula allows you to work out to your greatest potential.\n\nI have used AMRAP Beet Nitrates now a few times. I have used it prior to performing a variety of exercises, such as Zumba, power lifting, and running. <strong>The greatest success that I found with using it has been that it has increased my endurance.</strong> Some of my workouts can last as long as two hours depending on the day of the week and the part of the body I am targeting that day, so energy boost I gain from a healthy beet juice is insanely helpful.\n\nWith this energy increase, I have also found that I am able to endure longer workouts, which has motivated me to increase my workout time. Even though I haven't seen an improvement in, say, my running time in the short term, it certainly makes for an easier and more effective workout.\n\nI would highly recommend the Beet Nitrate formula from AMRAP Nutrition for any athlete that is looking for a safe, plant-based alternative to a traditional pre-workouts or endurance powders. It is made by people I trust, and who have my best interests at heart because they use beet juice in the same way.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1>My Favorite Features</h1>\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Beet-nitrates2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/products/beet-nitrates/ noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"wp-image-5684 size-medium alignright\" src=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Beet-nitrates2-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></h1>\n<ul>\n \t<li>All my friends can say a brief prayer to the gods in the sky - as nasty as a instant beet juice sounds, it actually taste really good; it's sweet and not earthy like you would think.</li>\n \t<li>It only takes 20 - 30 minutes to kick in and the benefits last upwards of 4 or more hours.

However, more rewarding than the results is the process. You will find that the self-discipline, personal toughness and satisfaction you earn in pursuing your goals is spiritual in nature. </span>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\"Nothing worth having comes easy.\" </strong></p>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1><b>1.) Eliminate Processed Sugar (and Soda)</b></h1>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Admit it, you often get sick right around the holidays. Ever wonder why? This is due to eating tons of sugary snacks and desserts. Who doesn't love those cookies, cakes and pies for every meal during the holidays. </span>\n\nBut you have to understand that processed sugar will destroy your body. Not only does it make you fat, it will make you sick. It causes inflammation, joint pain, and hardening of the arteries. It can also weaken your immune system and cause cancer.\n\nIt is also important to note that blood sugar spikes are the real cause of weight gain, not fat consumption. So if you want to lose weight, you are better off eating an entire stick of butter than you are drinking a can of soda (or mocha-frappuccino).\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Diet soda is actually worse, basically, they increase sugar cravings while changing the way your brain responds to simple sugars, causing your body to store them as fat.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1><b>2.) Drink Lots of Water</b></h1>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facts: our brain is 90% water and our body about 70%; the majority of our blood and every cell in our body are composed of water. Meaning, we need water for our body to function properly.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Water helps us think, focus, concentrate, recover, heal and function. It will increase your energy and endurance, keeps you active and alert. Flushes out toxins, boosts your immune system, and keeps you alive. </span>\n\nSo make it a daily habit to drink a lot of water (I'm 160lbs, very active and drink 3-liters daily) . To accomplish this you will need to keep it with you at all times (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B9G82XQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00B9G82XQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=a0140b74-20&amp;linkId=SNCAXMF3VUCXLG5X\" target=\"_blank\">I prefer these water bottles</a>). If you need to get up every time you get thirsty you're drinking too little too late.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">ProTip - To improve digestion try not to drink too much water right before a meal, because you don't want to dilute your stomach acid. I also press a lemon or lime into a glass of water following my meals, the citrus juice acts like an enzyme and will improve the digestion of your food.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1><b>3.) Morning Cardio</b></h1>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start each morning with a slow jog, ranging from 25 to 45-min in length. For weight loss this works best on an empty stomach before breakfast while your blood sugar levels are depleted. Morning exercise is also good for the brain and now the primary reason I jog every morning.</span>\n\nIf your goal is to lose weight, a good rule of thumb for cardio is to maintain the ability to have a conversation but at the intensity where it's difficult to talk too much. Depending on your fitness level, you can start off by walking for 20 minutes, then walk-jog until you’re jogging for 20 minutes, and then increase just a little every week. <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">But you must go for more than 20 minutes, as it takes your body that long to get to the fat burning stage.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ProTip - Start slow and at your own pace. You’ll be doing this new habit for years and you don't want to make the common mistake of going too hard too fast and burning out. In fact, if you hold back at the beginning it will be frustrating but will increase the likelihood that this new habit sticks. </span>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1><b>4.) Salads For Dinner</b></h1>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make it a habit to prepare a big salad with good protein every night instead of the carb heavy meal you usually have for dinner. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can have amazing salads with tons and tons of veggies and protein, covered with healthy fats like olive oil, nuts and avocado. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just remember that the goal here is to put your food on top of lettuce instead of potatoes and rice.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sounds horrible? Definitely not! It could take some getting used to, but once you do, you will be amazed on how good you feel and how much better you sleep at night. </span>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1><b>5.) Six Meals Per Day</b></h1>\nAvoid having three heavy meals per day. Why? Heavy meals tend to \"shock\" your system and will temporarily suck your energy. Your blood sugar level increases, but once the meal is fully digested, it falls abruptly, taking your energy and mood along with it.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having small meals five to six times a day help prevent this, making our bodies function more efficiently the whole day. The small, regular introduction of food keeps our energy levels balanced, making it easier for us to manage our activities and responsibilities for the day. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This also gives us the chance to have more variety in our diets, enabling us to get more of the nutrients we need. With each meal I strive for two different sugars, two carbs, a protein and a fat. </span>\n\nThis was my breakfast today:\n\n1/2 banana\n1/2 orange\n2 eggs\n1/2 cup rice\n1 piece of toast with olive oil\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*If you want to accelerate weight loss, eat fibrous carbs (ie. asparagus, broccoli, brussel sprouts)  instead of starchy carbs (ie. rice, bread, oats, pasta).\n</span>","Slug":"five-healthy-weight-loss-habits","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/health_tips/five-healthy-weight-loss-habits/","Path":"/health_tips/five-healthy-weight-loss-habits/","Date":"2016-03-18","Year":"2016","Month":"03","Day":"18","Categories":"Health Tips","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/strong-man.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/strong-man.jpg"},{"id":"5732","Title":"How To Form Habits That Stick","Content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a previous post, I shared my \"<a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/health_tips/five-healthy-weight-loss-habits/\">Five Healthy Weight Loss Habits</a>\".

Form One Habit At A Time</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In habit formation, it is imperative that we keep our focus and ONLY work to form one habit at a time.

Avoid all processed sugars, limit caffeine (and other stimulants) and control insulin levels by eating fats and protein with every meal. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tips:\nBuy a high-quality </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIGZXM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=a0d30946-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B000GIGZXM&amp;linkId=55dfa5e49fd54b289d10dfab5d64ef91\">Blendtec blender</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and fall in love with smoothies! Many athletes “supercharge” them with our Super Berries or Supergreens powders. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Help your body convert fat into usable energy by adding coconut <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/products/mct-powder/\">MCT powder</a> to your morning coffee. Blend and enjoy the benefits of ketosis.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Dehydration</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dehydration can damage muscles and significantly reduce the body’s ability to repair itself. Make sure you get plenty of water throughout the day. To ensure you always have water available, we recommend ordering two or three of these Nalgene water bottles.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tips:\nMake sure you’re getting enough high-quality </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IZL255O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=a0d30946-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00IZL255O&amp;linkId=b659cd3e5dfd2bb35acc5eed3b346f91\">Himalayan sea salt</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> throughout the day to improve your electrolyte balance.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Help detoxify your system by squeezing some lemon juice into your water first thing in the morning – before breakfast, coffee or even your shower. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Endurance athletes can see an immediate boost in recovery and performance by drinking nitrate-rich <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/products/beet-nitrates/\">beet juice</a> 30 minutes prior to a workout.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Protein</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Athletes need the amino acids found in protein. It’s vital to build, repair and heal muscles after a strenuous workout. The best sources of protein are high-quality grass-fed or wild-caught meats.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tips:\nTake a <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/products/glutamine/\">Glutamine</a> supplement. Glutamine is a natural amino acid found in meats, eggs and kale that speeds up recovery and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduces muscle soreness. Because it’s hard to get enough from diet alone, a supplement can make a big difference. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try our <a href=\"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/products/bcaa/\">BCAA powder</a> – it’s super-high-quality, vegan-friendly and unflavored. Take it before your workout to recover faster and build stronger, denser muscles.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Stretching</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an athlete, you need maximum flexibility in order to get the most out of your workouts and recovery. Stretching is also the best way to prevent injury. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip:\nStretch at least 10 minutes after every workout, using “long-hold” stretches (</span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A4CG3PE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=a0d30946-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01A4CG3PE&amp;linkId=5403df8997109ff7bea1abc10166b16f\">these straps help</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). Before the workout, do more active stretches in which you hold positions for just a moment.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Smash-N-Mash </b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much of the soreness that accompanies exercise results from the muscles and fascia – the connective tissue that runs through the body – becoming knotted. Foam rolling, or self-myofascial release, is an essential part of recovery, regardless of your athletic level. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip:\nThis is an </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XM2MRGI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=a0d30946-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00XM2MRGI&amp;linkId=a4052bc6cc9c37d8fe22486c3d784ee9\">inexpensive foam roller</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that every household should own. Also, lacrosse balls are perfect for getting deep into thick muscles. </span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>HRV Score</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HRV (heart rate variability) is a non-invasive and simple way to check in with your body to see what level of stress you can endure. By taking a daily HRV reading, you can better understand how hard you should push yourself on any given day. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip:\nWe recommend the free “Elite HRV” app and </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007S088F4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=a0d30946-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B007S088F4&amp;linkId=b30c5bda3f814ccbd9c9f60d4fe87dbc\">this Bluetooth heart-rate monitor</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is sensitive enough to measure your HRV. </span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Active Recovery</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rest days provide a necessary break from the strenuous exertions of training. While you shouldn’t push yourself on your off days, some light exercise like taking a walk or an easy bike ride will promote blood flow and help speed up the recovery process. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip:\nGet an </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NB86OYE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=a0d30946-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00NB86OYE&amp;linkId=0b19120ab02641d4504556ebde2a1b75\">audiobook account at audible.com</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help pass the time and nourish your brain during “active recovery” days.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Relax Your Mind</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chronic stress can aggravate inflammation, negatively affect your sleep, and impede your body’s ability to recover.  To help you bounce back faster and become more resilient, meditation is a great practice. Mindfulness meditation is the go-to form of meditation for athletes.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip:\nFind a mindfulness meditation coach near you, or download the free iPhone “Headspace” app.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Take a Deep Breath</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “4-7-8” technique is a simple breathing exercise that relaxes your body and calms your autonomic nervous system.  Simply breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, and breathe out for 8 seconds. Do this for as little at 2 minutes and you will feel like a different person. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip:\nEven if you’re an experienced athlete, practicing the “4-7-8” exercise will boost your performance and enable you to go beyond what you thought possible.</span>","Slug":"10-ways-to-maximize-your-post-workout-recovery","Permalink":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/health_tips/10-ways-to-maximize-your-post-workout-recovery/","Path":"/health_tips/10-ways-to-maximize-your-post-workout-recovery/","Date":"2017-07-21","Year":"2017","Month":"07","Day":"21","Categories":"Health Tips","Image URL":"https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/stair-climbing-workout.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/35-health-tips-exercise.jpg | https://www.amrapnutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/35196037_ml.jpg","Image Path":"/nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/stair-climbing-workout.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/35-health-tips-exercise.jpg | /nas/content/live/amrap/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/35196037_ml.jpg"}]}
